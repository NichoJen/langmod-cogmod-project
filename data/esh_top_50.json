My family has four kids in total: me, my elder sister (29F), younger sister (24F) and youngest brother (22M).\n\nExtended family attended our family dinner. So all of our significant others, our cousins, aunts and uncles etc. During the dinner my elder sister and youngest brother got into a mild disagreement. My sister seemed (at least to me) to be coming across as very aggressive out of frustration and losing said argument. The two of them were too absorbed in their argument to realise the rest of us were getting a bit fed up.\n\nEventually my sister got really fed up and said \u201cShut up, I\u2019m not going to argue with a 22 year old virgin.\u201d My brother hadn\u2019t done any personal attacks up until that point, it was completely unprovoked. I think it might have been the alcohol as my sister is a mean drunk. \n\nAnyway, I immediately told my sister to grow up and that she was making an embarrassment of herself. She replied by saying everyone knows he\u2019s a virgin and she didn\u2019t say anything wrong. This annoyed me as my bro definitely has confidence issues and doesn\u2019t need to be made fun of like this.\n\nSo I responded by saying how she slept with well over a hundred men while she was in college, and that since everyone in the family knows this it\u2019s not a big deal right? Turns out her husband didn\u2019t know this amazingly, I genuinely assumed he must have known. he left the party angrily saying my sister mislead him about her past.\n\nFamily is blaming me for their marital problems. I refuse to accept I did anything wrong. My sister bullied my brother in front of everyone, all I did was give her a taste of her own medicine.",

C was the one who made me laugh for the first time after my wife died. She\u2019s smart as hell (3 Ivy League degrees), has a dark sense of humor that I love, a terrific cook, and overall an amazing woman who I can imagine spending the rest of my life with. She is also on the heavier side, a fact that becomes relevant later.\n\nI have 2 children, E (25M) and A (19F). They were well aware that I had gotten a new GF before I first introduced them to C this summer. She got along immediately with E, but A was very very standoffish. After that initial meeting I asked A if there was something wrong but she denied it. C made a few more attempts to get to know A but they were all rudely rejected.\n\nE and A both came home for Thanksgiving dinner. I asked A to please be polite during the meal since she\u2019s always been rude in her interactions with C even though C has been nothing but gracious in return. The dinner was going as well as it could have for the first 10 minutes, although I noticed A glaring at C the entire time. When C went to grab her third helping of mashed potatoes, A said \u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019ve eaten enough, you fat pig?\u201d C started sobbing immediately and ran off into the bedroom. I felt my face turn red and told A to get out. \n\nAbout half an hour after A left I texted her stating that I would no longer pay her tuition unless 1. She apologized to C and 2. C accepts her apology. A must have assumed that I was bluffing because she instead doubled down on her behavior during Thanksgiving dinner. I then logged into her university\u2019s tuition payment website, canceled next semester\u2019s tuition, and sent A the screenshots. She called me crying and begging me to reconsider but I told her my mind was made up.",

Neither of them have a following in real life or on social media (they\u2019ve got under 1500 followers combined). \n\nAnyway last week I posted a group picture on Instagram of people celebrating a friends birthday. Everyone in the photo has got their arms around each other\u2019s shoulders. Very platonic. \n\nAnyway yesterday in a group chat between the three of us they asked me to take the photo down because they don\u2019t want \u201cthe public\u201d to know they are dating.

Hunter and I were about to head out to let them have the place to themselves, when Connor asked if we wanted to join them. I initially refused (bit too old to be playing drinking games), but he insisted and Hunter thought it\u2019d be fun to act like college students again.\n\nWe all got pretty drunk and Connor had the idea of playing Never Have I Ever. A few rounds in, the statement \u201cNever Have I Ever cheated before\u201d came up.\n\nNow\u2019s a good time to mention that Hunter is **staunchly** against cheating. His ex-fianc\u00e9 cheated on him and it emotionally wrecked him. And unfortunately, as a lot of dumb, immature 17 year olds do, I cheated on my \u201cboyfriend\u201d of 5 months. It was a stupid mistake, he found out, and (understandably) ended things. This was almost a decade ago, I obviously learned my lesson, and look back at that time with shame (and obviously never cheated since).\n\nWell my brother knows about this so when I didn\u2019t drink, he went \u201chey sis, what the hell? You know you cheated on (*insert ex\u2019s name*). You have to drink to that!\u201d\n\nMy boyfriend paused, looked at me, looked at him, and just walked out of the room.

He was my everything and more and I still don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to move on.\n\nConnor tried to apologize, but I feel nothing but sadness and emptiness.

I also have a 7 year-old lab mix who is the greatest dog in existence.\n\nOn Saturday, fiancee had a bachelorette party at home. I stayed with my parents but I left the dog with her because she likes having him there. However, *I made sure to tell her to put the dog in our bedroom once the party gets going*.\n\n5am on Sunday I get a frantic call that something's wrong with the dog. She was drunk, so I told her to get a taxi and go to the emergency vet clinic. When I got there, she looked like she hadn't stopped crying for hours and she couldn't even speak. Two of her friends were there so they told me my dog is alive but not well. I felt sorry for her for an entire 10 minutes while waiting for the doctor.\n\nBut then, the doctor told me my dog ingested large amounts of alcohol and chocolate edibles. The girls apparently thought it would be cool to leave everything out on short coffee tables, leave the dog to wander around instead of putting him in our bedroom, and then get wasted and not notice he was going to town with the booze and edibles.\n\nWhen we got home, I told my fiancee to pack and get out of my house and my life. I told her to tell her guests the wedding is off, and I'll tell mine. She was shocked, but she took her things and left.\n\n2 hours later, I get bombarded by messages on Messenger, Whatsapp, by her sisters, brother, brother's wife, her mom, her friends, telling me that I am insane to do this to her after 4 years. They started off defending her, but it quickly turned into insulting me.\n\nThe logical thing for me to do was look for comfort in my friends and family. Nope. They all fucking agree. My mom said: \"Well, it was a mistake, she didn't do it on purpose, besides - the dog didn't die!\" Lucky me, eh? My dog didn't fucking die!\n\nMy sister was appalled that I cancelled the wedding \"over *that*?!\" and even my best man said I might have overreacted. Yes, our relationship has had ups and downs, but it's mostly worked fine. But I am so disgusted at my fiancee that I can't even imagine looking her in the eye, let alone spending my whole life with her. She isn't fucking 17, she is 27!\n\nBy the way, this is not the first dumb thing she has done. She likes to text while driving, she always leaves stuff on the electric stove (like kitchen towels, the cutting board etc.) even though she has turned on the wrong burner and burnt whatever was on it several times in the past, and similar DANGEROUS things. It's not something I hold against her in the sense that I would ever mention in a fight, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried that she might end up killing herself or someone else. For example, my dog.\n\nI'm 99% sure I will stand by my decision. But am I really an asshole? Literally nobody is on my side and I have no idea what to think.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**",

I thought you were still in bed or something??\"\n\nI knew fine well that she was ready to leave the house but I didn't want to play this stupid game and I don't like the disrespect of being totally ignored like this, so I just decided to not pick her up.\n\nObviously she was mad at me and had no idea how to express her emotions besides bursts of anger and then ghosting.",

        "body": "For the past month my 24 year old niece has been living with us. I'll call her Princess because that's what her parents call her most of the time. She is a medical researcher (Studied medicine but wasn't interested in the practical side of things more interested in the theoretical) and took up a position near where we live, and my sister convinced me to let her stay so she can save money. I was apprehensive because I know this girl has been coddled and babied since she was little. \n\nWe have a 4 bedroom house. Me and my husband, my son (16), my daughter (21) and our 4 year old rottweiler Freddie. I told sister that Princess would have to sleep on the sofa in the living room which she seemed OK with, but when she arrived both mother and daughter set about trying to convince me to clear out the dog's room and let her sleep in it. Princess even said it would be OK to make him sleep outside because ''it's just a dog''. It's getting a lot colder now and I'd never let Freddie sleep outside. \n\nI told Princess that this is where she'd sleep, take it or leave it, and she was and still is really sulky about it, sulking about how we think a dog is more important than her. \n\nIn all honesty I was right in thinking having Princess stay is more trouble than it's worth. She goes out clubbing and partying a lot and makes no effort to keep the noise down when she comes home in the early hours of the morning. Since she's arrived the living room smells of weed and that smell definitely wasn't there before she came. \n\nShe's also rude to my kids. My daughter got engaged and we were all delighted, but Princess was lovely enough to say that if her BF had gotten her a ''cheap'' ring like that she wouldn't even get out of bed for the wedding. Daughter was in tears because of this and both husband and I had a word with Princess, who then cried and phoned up her mother saying we were rude to her. \n\nHad another phone call with sister today, and she still tried to convince me to put her daughter in the dog's room. I made clear this wasn't happening and sister got upset with me saying how nasty it was to value pets over family. I also said that her daughter was skating thin ice and that I wouldn't tolerate her behaviour for much longer. Sister was very offended and said we should be happy to have her daughter there. Sorry but how can I be happy to have a spoiled overgrown child who keeps trying to steal a room from a dog in my home?\n\n\n\nAlso, the people who claim that I was being nasty to her because I didn't like her and things like that. I don't dislike her at all. I was apprehensive about having her because having known her since she was born, I've seen many of her tantrums and seen her parents give in to them over and over again even into her adulthood. I was worried about how things would turn out since we wouldn't give into her demands. She has tried to pick on both my children when she was a teenager and we went through a period a few years back when my daughter refused to visit their home because Princess constantly bullied her. \n\nRegarding the dog's room. There isn't any furniture in Freddie's room that a 24 year old woman could comfortably sleep on, and we weren't about to go and buy furniture since we didn't know how long she'd be staying. \n\nAnd for those who think I was trying my best to make her uncomfortable, not at all. We tried our best to make her feel welcome. Gave her as much space as she wanted and left the living room whenever she needed privacy. We gave her food and while she brought more than enough clothes for home, I went clothes shopping with her and was happy to pay out of my own pocket. Within her first week here, Princess couldn't stop laughing when my daughter told her what she did for a living (hairdresser), said that Freddie should sleep outside and shouted at my husband because he hadn't cooked dinner quick enough, so you can't blame all this on me. \n\nRegarding the weed and clubbing thing: I've nothing against weed use. I smoked it a few times as a teenager, as did my husband, and I'm 99% sure my kids have both done it at some point, but that fact is it's completely illegal in this country. If she was doing it away from the house I would not care at all. I wouldn't even have too much of a problem if she was smoking it outside, but it is obvious from the strong smell that she is smoking it in the house. I'm well aware that going out clubbing and making noise is what most people her age do. However, this particular 24 year old doesn't bother to take her high heels off when she comes in, and as we have a wooden floor we can hear her stomping around in them which wakes us all up. \n\nLast but not least, I didn't call her ''Princess'' on here offensively. I wasn't going to put her real name on here obviously, and the fact is her parents genuinely do nickname her Princess most of the time, and she doesn't mind it when they call her it.",

My girlfriend hangs out with Amy quite often. I see her from time to time, but I\u2019ve never cared for her cheeky attitude. The tipping point was tonight. \n\n\nDinner was going alright until Amy\u2019s boyfriend innocently commented on how little my girlfriend ate. She usually gives me half her entr\u00e9e. After that, Amy, who isn\u2019t stick thin like my girlfriend, snidely remarked that my girlfriend wouldn\u2019t need fake boobs if she ate like a real woman. \n\n\nI loudly told her to watch her fat goddamn mouth and that her comment was both rude and unnecessary. Amy isn\u2019t overweight by most standards, but that adjective slipped out because of what she said prior. Many people turned their eyes toward us. \n\n\nMy girlfriend and Amy\u2019s boyfriend tried to quell the ruckus, but Amy got up and told me to have fun with my Barbie doll before she motioned Amy\u2019s boyfriend to get up and leave with her. Don\u2019t worry, you pay before you get your food at this restaurant. \n\n\nMy girlfriend and I talked about Amy. She kept saying that Amy and some of her friends make those comments all the time and they don\u2019t mean them to be derogatory. I tried to convince my girlfriend that no friend would make those types of comments and she\u2019s better off without someone like Amy in her life. \n\n\nMy girlfriend still thinks that Amy didn\u2019t mean to hurt her with the \u201creal woman\u201d and \u201cBarbie doll\u201d comments and I didn\u2019t read the room correctly.

I was kicked out of her wedding party because I was uncomfortable wearing a very revealing bridesmaid's gown. This wasn't that big of a deal as we're not exactly close since she got with my ex. However, she still expects me to take on all the duties of a bridesmaid. I told her that was ridiculous and that she needed to find a new bridesmaid. She then almost uninvited me from the wedding but instead decided I could go I follow a very specific set of rules (ranging from how to dress to who I could talk to). I was absolutely crushed as I was still looking forward to the wedding even if I wasn't going to be in it. I found out through a mutual friend who is still in the wedding party the bride continuously makes fun of me and talks shit about me constantly and so do several of the other bridesmaids. I was about to just not go when I ran into the bride's ex who is also invited to the wedding (He's the groom's cousin). He was also kicked out of the wedding party and was given a list of rules to follow. He and I have decided we're going to go together and have fun breaking as many rules that we can (such as wearing what we want to wear, drinking at the open bar, talking to whoever we want to, and dancing- WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DANCE). Nothing we would do would distract from the bride's big day other than breaking the ridiculously petty rules that we're supposed to follow. We're also both at the point where we're both ready to sever ties with the bride and groom. Would we be the assholes?

I moved an hour and a half away when I was 18 and we \ndon\u2019t see eachother often, but I make a point to call/text\n\n\nIt was her birthday yesterday and I thought I\u2019d splurge since she\u2019s been going through a rough time. She\u2019s changed schools twice due to bullying and our mom always tells me that she won\u2019t talk to anyone, is having intense mood swings, etc. I\u2019ve made multiple attempts to help her, but she shuts me down and gets snippy.\n\n\n\nAnyway, I got her a set of 150$ artist grade markers called Copics. I\u2019m no art connoisseur, but apparently every artist who\u2019s anybody has them and our parents don\u2019t wanna spend that kind of money for her hobby (they\u2019re about 5$ PER MARKER) and tend to give practical gifts like clothes. Whenever we\u2019ve texted recently it\u2019s been her ranting about them not getting them for her.\n\neven on her birthday she was like a bomb about to go off. She barely acknowledged me and only said hello when she was asked. I was excited to give her the gift but the second I opened it she grabbed them and turned to our mom, saying \u201cSee! Even he knows you should\u2019ve got them for me!\u201d Which I awkwardly brushed off. Everytime she opened a gift from our parents it was very snotty like \u201cOh, yayyyy, cheap sneakers, my favorite.\u201d \u201cA plaid skirt. WOW. I\u2019m blessed.\u201d \n\n\nI was prepared for an angsty teen, but I soon reached my limit. Our dad showed her a journal they bought and she suddenly yelled \u201cI told you both exactly what I wanted but you spent the same amount of money on shit I don\u2019t need! Fuck this!\u201d she threw it against the wall and ran up to her room.\n\n\n\nOur parents were a lot less well-off when I was her age, and they could barely afford a birthday for me. Everytime it was a dodgy cake and a handful of clothes without holes in them, I accepted them like I was the luckiest kid ever. I would\u2019ve never swore and yelled but she\u2019s been very spoiled.\n\n\nI talked with them for awhile and apparently shes done worse before which shocks me. They think even if they can afford it now, she should learn the value of a dollar. I agree helped shape me to not have my every whim be attended to. Besides, she got what she wanted in the end, why is she still mad in the first place?\n\n\nSister came back to get the markers, but I took them back. I said that she was ungrateful and I wouldn\u2019t tolerate it. She started screaming at me but I just left the \u201cparty\u201d prematurely with the gift in tow.\n\n\n\nMy whole family is blowing up my phone because I \u201cruined her birthday\u201d. In my eyes, I spent 150$ to get no thank-you and yelled at. This will teach her a valuable lesson and maybe spark a change in her teen angst phase. But my family doesn\u2019t want to hear from me until I give it back. Considering I\u2019ve got my entire family shitting on me, I have to wonder if I did make the wrong choice. So, reddit, AITA?",

        "body": "Hi AITA. I am going to try to make this as brief as possible so I don't ramble.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dated Em for a year and a half. During this time I confided in her some personal secrets, which I don't feel comfortable sharing even anonymously. Because of these she knows that there are certain things, related to sex mostly, that I am very sensitive towards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe did not part on friendly terms after our breakup and we don't talk anymore. I broke up with her because I found out she cheated on me, and she flipped out. Recently I found out that she is seeing one of my coworkers, and that he is spreading rumors about me that she told him. She basically told him bits and pieces of the personal information I shared with her when we were together and now he's spreading some of that around the office.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sent her a message telling her to stop spreading my secrets around and to leave me alone. She replied sending me explicit videos of herself having sex with my coworker because she knew it would hurt me. That was the last straw for me, and I sent the video to all of her family and friends with the message that \"this is what Em sends me when I ask her to leave me alone and stop spreading rumors.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer familly is quite religious and they lost it. Apparently, they pulled their financial support for her college and arent speaking with her atm. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR my ex sent me unsolicited sexual videos when i asked her to leave me alone. I sent them to her family. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Well this blew up. I'll try and answer some of the things I have seen asked most often here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1: I feel somewhat obligated to clear the air that no, the information being spread was not that I have a small dick, or anything else that was trivial. To put things as general as possible, and to give an idea of how serious the rumors being spread were, I was a victim of CSA for a period of several years, and it had a pretty profound impact on my life. It led to me doing some pretty stupid things to cope with it, as well as having a bunch of issues that I struggle with to this day (I never hurt anyone in any way, but there's some shit that I've done that I'd like to not have spread around). She has been picking and choosing the parts from my history that she feels will most hurt me to have spread around, and adding a few stories of her own here and there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2: By all of her friends and family, I meant her parents, brother, and a couple of close friends. I worded that terribly. I have not been in the best headspace as of late. Sorry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3: We have not spoken since. I have no desire to speak to her ever again. My coworker has been on sick leave (apparently) for the past couple days and I have not heard anything from him. As petty and shitty as this sounds, she can die for all I care. I have gone to bed hating myself for ever involving myself with that person ever since she cheated on me. Maybe I am an asshole too for my reaction, but she can get bent. I feel no guilt whatsoever for any shit she has to go through because of this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4: I will be speaking to my lawyer tomorrow to see what he thinks. I have the money to fight a legal case if I have to, though obviously, I would rather not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyeah. that pretty much the main things I wanted to clear up. I'll go through the thread tomorrow if I feel up to it and see if there's anything else. It's a bit of a shitshow and I'm not really emotionally in the right place to read through 1k+ comments atm",

I've done everything to support her. I make breakfast everyday and I make it a point to make whatever she asks me to make. \n\nYesterday, my wife woke me up at 2am and told me that she wanted to eat icecream. We had no ice cream left because she ate it all at night. I really wanted to get her the ice cream. She told me that she wanted choco chip. I drove for an hour to find a place at that time. But they didn't have any choco chip at that time. I didn't want to disappoint her, so I got strawberry, her next favourite flavour. \n\nWhen I got back, I told her that I didn't find choco chip. Idk what happened but she started crying and yelling  at me. She threw away the ice cream, called me a fucking imbecile and told me I didn't love her. She also told me that she didn't want to sleep next to me. I slept in another room. \n\nNow today, she comes to me, cries, apologizes and tells me that she was really stressed out. But I did not sleep with her at night. I've decided that I don't want to do anything now. This is not the first time this has happened. I'm not a fantastic cook. She insists that I make something for her, but when I make it she always tells me that it's horrible. She later apologizes and tells me that it was wonderful ( all this started after the pregnancy ).

Many people were thanking him for his service, and frankly it just felt like the only reason he wore that was to be in the spotlight and make it about him, which I don't think you are supposed to do at someone else's wedding. If he wants to wear that to his own wedding then fine, but the whole point of having a dress code at a wedding is so that no one guest will stand out too much.

        "body": "Not my story, but my brother's, and I'm really unsure where I stand on it.\n\nMy little brother, is doing an internship with a large corporation. He organized an internal food drive, in which the floor that donates the most wins free pizza for lunch on a Friday. \n\nAt the conclusion of the food drive, my brother called the pizza place on a Monday and asked about the logistics of ordering 35 pizzas, on a Friday, during lunch hour. They said it wouldn't be a problem, and to place the order Wednesday morning. \n\nHe calls back Wednesday, and speaks with the same manager. The manager tells him they can no longer do the order, as it's too big of an order to do during their Friday lunch rush. He recommends my brother try the middle of the following week, and they agree on the following Tuesday.\n\nMonday rolls around and my brother places the order, and uses the corporate credit card to pay over the phone. The manager then tells him they cannot have 35 pizzas ready at 12:30, but can have 18 ready at noon, and another 17 ready at 12:45. My brother tells him that would work. When asked what to put on the line for a tip amount, my brother responds $0.\n\nNoon on Tuesday, my brother shows up at the pizza place, picks up the first 18 pizzas, and delivers them to the winning office floor lunch room. Then, he returns to the store to pick up the remaining 17 pizzas. \n\nWhile waiting for the second round of pizzas at the store, the following exchange occurs:\n\nManager: \"Are you going to leave a tip?\"\n\nBrother: \"No.\"\n\nManager: \"Usually with large orders like this you are required to leave a tip\"\n\nBrother: \"You aren't delivering or serving these pizzas. When we talked on the phone yesterday you did not mention a mandatory tip\".\n\nManager: \"It's corporate policy that orders this large require a 15% gratuity\". \n\nBrother: \"That isn't what we agreed to on the phone yesterday. I'm not leaving a tip\".\n\nManager: \"Well then you aren't getting the rest of your pizzas\". \n\nAt this point, my brother and the manager begin arguing, escalating to the point of my brother's coworker pulling him to the side and recommending a small tip (5%). My brother relents. He tells the manager he will leave a tip, but he wants to choose the amount. He hands the manager his card, who runs it and hands him back a new receipt for the order, with a 15% gratuity assessed ($125 instead of $40).\n\nMy brother then gets into a yelling match with the manager, and is escorted out of the restaurant by his coworker. \n\nIs my brother the asshole?",

        "body": "I have 2 kids, different dads. I have a savings account for both. The account of my oldest, Lucy, has had \u00a310 per week added to it by both myself and her father, and has gone up by about a grand a year and is over \u00a313,000. The second account is for my son, Luke, who is 6. I have regularly added to this account since I found out I was pregnant, and have about 3.5k in the account.\n\nHis father, my fiance, had a separate account for Luke and has told me he was doing the \u00a310 a week since we started the accounts. I recently found out the account he has for Luke only has a couple hundred in it. My fiance earns less than me but more than my Ex. If my Ex can afford \u00a310 a week routinely, when he has nearly identical spending habits to me and my fiance but lives alone and therefore pays for rent/bills in full, and my fiance earns more than my Ex, there is no reason my fiance should not have been able to make the \u00a310 payments each week (I earn the most of all 3 of us, followed by my fiance, followed by Ex). My fiance said he \"forgot\" and asked me to redistribute the contents of Lucy's fund to make up for the money missing from Luke's. I said fuck no.\n\nLuke's account is around 3k less than it should be. We have a wedding fund that contains a little over 2k of mine and my fiance's combined money. We don't want a huge wedding but we do want a really nice honeymoon where we can just go away for a week and not worry about money while we're there or returning.\n\nMy fiance says that he doesn't have the money to replace the 3k Luke is missing all at once. I have said that I want to take the wedding fund as it currently stands and deposit the lot into the savings account I control that is meant for Luke. I would not be doing this if my fiance had not 1) lied for around 7 years about saving for our son, 2) claimed he did not have the money to replace it, 3) suggested I take money from my daughter, saved up with help from my Ex, to fix my fiance's mistake. I also said that I want him to set up a direct deposit of \u00a310 to the account that only I control each week. I will not budge on any of this as we agreed years ago now that this was a good idea and that it was important to invest in our son's future, and he has lied to me for 7 years now about making that investment.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor people asking why this is so urgent to me: It's not the end of the world if the full amount isn't in Luke's account any time soon, as the plan was always to give each kid the total in the account when they were 18/moving out, but my fiance says he can't afford to repay the money in bulk or multiple installments and if he keeps on not paying, then when Lucy is 18 she'll have 19-20 grand, and when Luke is 18 he'll get closer to 10k from just me. While I don't doubt he'd be grateful for whatever he gets, he'd get half of what Lucy will if my fiance doesn't make up the difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate:\n\nI asked him again why he didn't have the money. He said he just didn't. I asked him to bring up his bank statement, or payslip, or anything that shows how much money he has (bearing in mind he was last paid on the 28th and today is the 30th). He refused. I told him that if we were combining finances in any way I should be able to see where his money is going. He responded that I wasn't showing him my financial information, so I pulled up my banking app so he could see my own balance and transaction history. He then showed me his last statement, which his bank emailed him today. We had a fight and he's staying in a hotel tonight, which it turns out he can more than afford. He has nearly 60k in his personal current account and savings accounts, presumably meant solely for himself.\n\nI cannot see us getting married after this. Not ever. It's not just the trust issue, but also that he, knowing he had nearly 60k in savings, decided that it was okay to try and guilt trip me into taking money meant for my daughter to fix it for him.",

        "body": "My wife and I bought a house a couple of years ago. It's decent-sized yard and we even have a couple of chickens (this is Los Angeles). We have three boys - 6yo twins and a 9yo. They are kids. They are loud. Not screaming loud. They love playing in the yard and playing at the park literally across the street. My next door neighbors complain all the time about the noise level in the yard and at the park. They are this boomer retired couple with kids my age (mid-30's). Actually most of the neighborhood is like that because so few people especially with kids can afford a house in that area so it's a bunch of retired boomer snitches with Ring and security cameras at their front porch (no, NOTHING ever happens here) and they designated my neighbor as the block cop. The funny thing is that the kids are hardly home. They're in school most of the day and have sporting practices/games on the weekend.\n\nI tried to reason with them, but they feel that because they lived in their house for 40 years that we have to follow their rules as their next door neighbors and keep quiet. I have no sympathy for them. These are the people who bought their sizable home for $40,000 in the 80s and if adjusted for inflation, it's like buying the same house for $125K. But it's a house in LA so it's more like a million. My wife and I make good money, but our mortgage is astronomical. We are working much harder than our neighbors ever did.\n\nYesterday, our neighbor came to our door and asked complained, again, about our kids being loud. Not too loud. Just loud. At the park. Per the other neighbors who lived across the street from said park. Then he lectured me about my \"logic\" of moving to a quiet area with loud kids. If that wasn't bad enough, he suggested that my wife and I look at homes by the ocean because \"you don't have neighbors to the west of you.\" Houses by the ocean are like millions of dollars lol. I asked him how I would do that and he said that wasn't his problem. So I told him that he should move out of their house and move to the ocean where he won't have neighbors. I caught some flack for being rude to an older person, but I don't think I was.",

We\u2019ve become good friends over the past year or so, and we hang out most weekends. We are both into knitting and wine, and we are both really chill.\n\nIdeal friendship, right? Well, she has a 15 y/o son (Braden), who is really unclean. He stinks like rotting meat and BO, and he also has this awful metallic odor that makes me gag. I know it\u2019s not a neglect issue, because Chloe\u2019s younger daughter (11F) has never stunk. Lately, I haven\u2019t even wanted to go over to Chloe\u2019s, and I don\u2019t want to invite her to my house in case she brings her son. \n\nLady week was the last straw. We decided to go to the craft store together, and Braden wanted to come. I drove them there, and my upholstery stank for a good three days after. The next day at work, Chloe asked if I wanted to come over for dinner, and I had to tell her no. She really pushed me for a reason, and I told her her son smells like ass and I basically can\u2019t be around him until he works on his cleanliness. She sent me a text later (pasted here): \u201cHi yall-need-weed, the things you said about Braden were really uncalled for and I don\u2019t want you to talk about my kids in a bad way. I am a good mom. Don\u2019t talk to me until you apologize.\u201d\n\nAITA? Should I apologize?\n\nEdit for more info: yes, I did unfortunately phrase it that way. We both cuss a lot, but I definitely could\u2019ve been gentler. \n\nNo, I won\u2019t be calling the authorities on Chloe. Their house is clean, he has access to washer/ dryer/ shower, this kid just inexplicably reeks.\n\nYes, Braden comes with his mom to my house a lot. He doesn\u2019t really have friends or out of school activities, and he likes some of the gaming systems I have.\n\nEdit 2: no, I\u2019m not one of those childfree people who hates kids. I\u2019m mainly childfree because I like the freedom, and I\u2019ve never really had a maternal instinct. \n\nAlso, \u201cLady week\u201d was a typo - I meant \u201clast week\u201d.

So far, so good.\n\nWe went to her house for dinner, and she had a number of vegetable dishes on the table to share. MIL told us that they were vegan, so that's what we had. However, at the end of the meal, MIL decided to reveal to us that those dishes were cooked in butter. \"See? A little bit of butter isn't that bad, is it? Maybe this will teach you to stop being so uptight about that whole vegan thing.\" she said. Of course we were not okay with her lying to us whatsoever, and she decided to tell us that we were being \"entitled\".\n\nThis year, we hosted a vegan Thanksgiving dinner at our house. My husband asked me what I thought about inviting MIL over, and whether it was okay with me given what happened last year. I thought about it and I had an idea. My MIL absolutely hates cucumbers and melons, and will not eat them under any circumstances. She will also refuse to eat zucchini, because they apparently look too similar to a cucumber. She also refuses to eat cilantro. So I suggested to my husband that we include these ingredients in every single thing we cook for the dinner if we are to invite her over. He thought about it, and agreed that she deserves it after the stunt she pulled last year.\n\nSo for Thanksgiving, we made a number of dishes: a tomato and zucchini casserole; a salad that included both cucumber, melon, and cilantro; some green beans and mashed potatoes, of course with tons of cilantro. We even added some cucumber and melon to our water jug as well. When she came over and saw the meal, she refused to eat any of it.\n\nAITA?",

Brothers gf is a heavy girl and weight is a very touchy issue with her. Well, recently both of us have taken to calling her miss piggy when she eats our food.

She\u2019s an older teen and has had lots of issues since she started high school, mostly stemming from rebellion, I think. Her father always played the \u201cDisney dad\u201d role (because she only stayed with him every other weekend + summers/holidays). So discipline was solely on me.

(She would have already graduated but that\u2019s a whole other story). \n\nWhat I mentioned in the title was my final straw. I trusted her to leave her alone but ended up coming home early when my plans got ruined last minute. (Was hanging out with a group of friends, but the host\u2019s kid got sick, so we all ended up leaving early). So I walk in on my daughter in my bed with some guy I don\u2019t even know. \n\nI told her I have had it and she\u2019s going to live with her dad. That means she\u2019s either going to have a 45 min commute to school or transfer. I don\u2019t really care which at this point because I am at my breaking point. If her dad won\u2019t take her in full time, she can go live with friends, I guess, but I\u2019m not planning on giving financial support. (My ex and I had a CS agreement that ended at 18, no caveats). \n\nAm I wrong for reaching my limit with this extreme boundary cross? My sister thinks I\u2019m being harsh. I said, in that case, she can take her! But at this point, I feel like I\u2019m done.\n\n**Edit: I came here for judgment, but some of the comments implying that I might have \u201cabused\u201d my daughter or that I somehow \u201cdeserved\u201d for my space to be violated this way because I\u2019m a \u201cshit mom\u201d are really shocking. I won\u2019t be participating in this thread anymore. I\u2019m fine being told I\u2019m wrong and listening to different perspectives.  But being personally degraded just isn\u2019t for me.

My boss was a little irritated and told me to remove it or kill it, I straight up refused and told him he wouldn\u2019t ask Michelle to remove her dog and the spider is a LOT less threatening than a poorly behaved dog.

She said, \u201cOh I get it, you\u2019re attracted to coked up skeletons like your girlfriend.\u201d Referring to the fact that my girlfriend is tall and skinny. I got defensive and said, \u201cWell Im not attracted to fat basic bitches like you.\u201d Granted, she\u2019s not even fat, just thick/chunky. But she does overdo the spray tan and she looks like every basic girl ever. I guess a lot of guys are after that look but not me.\n\nShe called me a cunt and later her friends found her in the bathroom crying. People are villifying me but she practically pushed me to it, especially insulting my girlfriend like that. I stand by what I said though, and she should know that her words have consequences.

        "body": "On my birthday this year, I treated myself to 50 bucks in lottery tickets, and managed to hit one of the huge $50,000 payouts. After taxes, I had ~$34,000, so I\u2019ve put $7,500 into my wife\u2019s car, and put the rest into a high-interest bank account. I\u2019m planning to switch jobs early 2020, but first, I plan to travel for the month of January and half of February across Asia and Europe. I\u2019ve never had a proper vacation (unless you count weekend trips to Disney World for the kids) and have really wanted to take the chance to go out there and explore the world.\n\nWell yesterday my daughter Emily were talking about the job movement and the topic of the vacation came up. I told her about how I\u2019m financing it with the lottery (she previously did not know about the winnings) and Emily went quiet before saying \u201cinstead of wasting 25 grand on a vacation, why not do something practical like maybe spend $5,000 on a vacation and help your daughter not graduate with mountain of debt\u201d.\n\nI told her that I\u2019d be happy to co-sign loans for her, but I was only willing to pay upwards of $10,000 of her education (the amount I promised both her and her brother when they were 13-15). She said even after paying that off, she\u2019s looking to be at being $29,000 in debt by the time she finishes school. \n\nI told her that really sucks, but reminded her that I offered community college as an option years ago when she was applying to schools, but she insisted that she didn\u2019t want to \u201cmiss out on the prestige\u201d (she got into Dartmouth). I talked to her about how transferring was an option, but she ultimately picked that route.\n\nShe\u2019s brought up how the 10k I gave Jason (my son) was enough to completely pay for college cost + some extra spending change, because he got a state scholarship that paid for 100% tuition. She argued how it\u2019s not fair that I was essentially willing to pay all of his college but leave her with a mountain of debt.\n\nI told her that he\u2019d be able to argue the same thing if she got more money than he did. Ultimately, the line I drew was that both children get equal amounts and I can choose how I want to spend my money, end of discussion.\n\nI thought it was over but it turns out that she went and talked to my wife Amy about it behind my back. Amy tried to \u201cpersuade\u201d me to make it a 2-3 week vacation as opposed to the 1.5 months I had planned. I told her the same thing that I told our daughter, and then SHE then got mad and said that I\u2019m being selfish and using all of the money that for myself (nevermind the amount I put into *her* car AND the fact that she used ALL of a $5,000 inheritance on cosmetic plastic surgery 4 years back). I told her this vacation was non-negotiable.\n\nNow I have two women in this household giving me passive aggressive looks and eyerolls. I feel like they\u2019re both acting entitled to MY shit; am I really being unreasonable here?\n\nEDIT I'm not leaving my wife behind; she can go for 10 days. She can't take the full 1.5 months off, though.",

        "body": "Some context is definitely needed here. I'm 33(M), and my sister is 36. She has one child (14F). I have one son (13). It is also important to add that I am a single father - my wife passed when my son was 7. \n\nMy son is quite gifted (I do not say this lightly). He tops all of his classes and often wins mathematics competitions in our state. I do not tell my sister this on account of me not wanting to seem like I'm bragging or anything - my son's achievements are his and his alone - I just provide him with the love and affection he is entitled to.\n\nSo yesterday, my family had a gathering dinner. At previous gatherings, my sister likes to demonstrate how 'special' and praiseworthy her daughter was for quite ridiculous achievements - such as winning 'best dressed' at her school dance.\n\nThis gathering, she really made me mad. Not only did she tell everyone the usual so-called achievements of her daughter, but she also targeted my son in front of him. She said, with the entire family present, that I wish my son was as gifted as her daughter. Her daughter proceeded to join in and call my son, who is quite shy, a looser.\n\nI then told her that her daughter was not special at all and that her achievements were absolutely nothing and meant nothing to anyone except for her. She left the table crying.\n\nI was then called an asshole by those remaining on the table. AITA?",
