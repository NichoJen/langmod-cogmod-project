When I first told them they thought I was joking, but they underestimated how committed I would be to a joke.

They started giving me information about how unhealthy it was to only eat apples, and growing increasingly exasperated by it. Some of them even got angry.\n\nBut I wanted to stick with the joke. Finally, after the end of 3 weeks, I walked into what I was told was a movie night but was actually an intervention for me. \n\nThey were all super concerned about my well being and had all sorts of information or whatever. Finally I started laughing hysterically. They were confused as hell so I told them I had been faking it the whole time and had been eating real meals outside their knowledge. I even took out some beef jerky from my pant pocket to prove it and munched it. \n\nI thought they'd appreciate the joke but they were actually really annoyed. My girlfriend even broke up with me over this because a few days ago I had ruined our date night when I told the waiter I only wanted apples because I was an Appletarian and had \"embarrassed her for a dumb joke\". \n\nIn my opinion the joke was solid and they should appreciate my commitment to the prank. \n\nBut, did I go too far?\n\n",

They knew the ceremony time, and my husband and I made it very clear to everyone, both in the invites and in person, that we were going to start exactly at that time.

All of our other guests were already there, and we wanted to be considerate of their time. \n\nMy parents showed up 15 minutes later and missed the entire ceremony.

        "body": "This is a hot topic in my family at the moment, \n\nI live on an obscure little island near the UK. we have a local quiz show that\u2019s aired on the telly that I appeared on a few years ago. \n\nThe premise of the show is that you can win prizes for doing challenges. Some of the challenges were physical, some psychological, and some requiring problem solving skills. I sailed through a lot of the physical part because I wasn\u2019t a fat bastard back then, and the problem solving skills required a lot of maths which is my career, so I was ok there.\n\nAs for the psychological part, you had to enter a clear box \u2018room\u2019 filled with something you\u2019re terrified of, and search through to find clues to the next part. \n\nI thought of a believable lie before I entered the show (we had to list 5 things we were afraid of) and I put down all the things I\u2019m *not* scared of. I listed spiders, cockroaches, snakes, scorpions, and wood lice. I literally couldn\u2019t care less about any of these creatures. I grew up in rural landscape and I\u2019ve had to pretty much deal with creepy crawlies my entire life so it\u2019s not an issue. My actual fear is a bit more obscure and I really honestly knew I\u2019d fail if I was put in a room with it. \n\nWhen I entered the room there were cockroaches *everywhere* I was in my boxers and barefoot (which was incredibly gross I can\u2019t lie) and had to sift through and move the cockroaches to find clues for my next challenge.\n\nI did it in the time period ascribed to me and got through to the next part. The rest of the contestants failed.\n\nNow, I won a pretty average car which I didn\u2019t particularly want, so as soon as I legally could I sold it and made a nice profit since it was pretty much brand new and bought myself a rather nicer car.\n\nI told my family this recently on a drunken night when we were all at a get together, and although everybody found it uproariously funny, my family are split into 2 camps- some people think I cheated and was ethically and morally wrong, and other people think the other contestants deserved to lose if they listed their *actual* fears.\n\nI\u2019m obviously in the latter category, but genuinely wondering what others think.",

        "body": "I know from the title, it definitely sounds like I would be the asshole but please hear me out. I have an older cousin whose son, my nephew, is in his early 20s. My nephew is autistic and holds a part time job, but is significantly delayed in many developmental areas (I don\u2019t know the specifics) and will never be independent according to his parents. \n\nRecently, my cousin and cousin-in-law have been thinking about relocating to our state because of recent job opportunities, and we\u2019ve hosted them in the past when they\u2019ve visited. The first time they stayed with us (before my son was born), my nephew seemed to develop a strong attachment to my wife and always wanted to be near her. He drew a picture of a heart and picked some flowers from our yard and gave them to her before they left, saying he loved her. My wife thought this was sweet and gently handled his crush by telling him she would always love him as his aunt, but she was sure he would find another girl to fill his heart soon. He told her no, she was his girlfriend. \n\nThis weekend, they were staying with us again and my nephew again wanted to be near my wife every chance he got. His mom and dad noticed and told him that because my wife now had to care for our son, she couldn\u2019t pay attention to him as much as before. He got upset telling us that she was his girlfriend and had a meltdown, which caused my son to start crying. When my wife got up to take our son to another room to calm him down, my nephew got up to follow and his dad had to forcibly restrain him from following them. I stood up to block the hallway into the separate room just in case he got away from his dad. \n\nOnce they calmed him down, they apologized for his behavior and said they would keep better tabs on him. Here\u2019s the part where I may be the asshole. I told my cousins I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with my nephew being so possessive of my wife, and I know for sure she didn\u2019t, especially since he seemed to be so jealous of our son. I told them I couldn\u2019t allow their son in our home until he learned to control himself and understand that my wife was not his girlfriend. I apologized but asked them to get a hotel room for the rest of their stay and not to visit us again unless they left my nephew behind with people they could trust and knew would care for him, while they searched for jobs in our state. They didn\u2019t say anything but looked saddened and went to the guest room with their son to pack up their bags. \n\nI guess they must have told my extended family what happened because my paternal grandmother called me this afternoon, telling me that I should\u2019ve been more understanding and that I was wrong to ask them to leave. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEDIT for added info: \n\nThank you to everyone who took the time to comment or private message me with their own experiences with family members who are/were autistic. There\u2019s not nearly enough time for me to respond to each of the comments (which honestly surprised me when I saw how many had reached out to me), but I wanted to address some questions that had been asked. \n\n1. The first one is that technically, my cousin is my second cousin. My dad is an only child so the cousin I refer to in my post, is the son of my own dad\u2019s first cousin (my paternal grandmother and his paternal grandfather were siblings). I\u2019m not sure if this is correct but his autistic son would technically be my third cousin(?). The reason I refer to him as my nephew is because he\u2019s the generation after mine in our family tree and it\u2019s less of a mouthful to refer to him as cousin-x-removed. A lot of people have posted that it\u2019s not correct to refer to him as my nephew but to be frank, I don\u2019t care, and my family\u2019s never followed this traditional genealogy nomenclature. I apologize if it was misleading in my post. Without being specific, in the western state I was born and grew up in, it\u2019s not uncommon to refer to even close (unrelated) adults as uncles or aunts. I call him my nephew because my cousin and I were close and I still hope to have a close relationship with him if at all possible (though I don\u2019t know how after this situation). \n\n2. Some have asked if I was jealous of my nephew calling my wife his gf. The first time, I thought it was amusing and was surprised that he had any romantic notions towards anyone, let alone my wife. Remember, in my mind he\u2019s my nephew and I never thought of him as anything other than a large kid because of his developmental delays and normal (for him) childlike behavior. Regarding the situation that happened this weekend, I was only concerned for my wife and son\u2019s safety. I didn\u2019t know how he would react and followed my cousin\u2019s lead, but wasn\u2019t about to let him get near my wife and son once they left the room. \n\n3. I don\u2019t know what was said to my paternal grandmother but I don\u2019t want to react in anger and want to talk to my cousin once we\u2019ve both had time to process what happened and calmed down.",

        "body": "For the last year I\u2019ve had a rewards card to a local gas station chain that lets me get deals and store coupons. \n\n\nAbout a week ago I went into the store to get a beverage, and swiped my rewards card before swiping my debit, however after the card reader finished processing the rewards card the total due went to 0 and the cashier asked if I wanted a receipt. At this point I figured I had just used a deal I don\u2019t know about, but the next time I went the same thing happened. So the next several times I\u2019ve gone I\u2019ve made around 10 dollar purchases with a variety of different items, and every single time it\u2019s been free.\n\n\nI\u2019m thinking something is wrong and I should tell someone, but I kinda wanna keep getting free stuff. AITA?\n\nUpdate: Hi guys\n\nI thought I had the golden ticket, I really did. \n\nI thought I had the coveted, all expenses paid, lifetime gas station experience moving forward. The rewards card that wouldn\u2019t stop rewarding. Last night I dreamed about all the bags of mixed nuts, the hardest of the boiled eggs, the bottles of old orange juice, the not-so-hot dogs that have been rolling right next to the hispanic egg rolls for the last 6 hours, that were just sitting there waiting for me to get my grubby, stinky little paws on them.\n\n\nI wanted to ask you fine people if I was the asshole real quick before I went balls deep and pilfered my way through a Midwest convenience store chain. I\u2019ll be honest I didn\u2019t care what people said though. I was high on the fact that I had, more or less, the most power in the entire world.\n\n\nAfter I made the post I made my daily trip to indulge in my kingdom, not caring that like 15 people on my post had just been like, \u201cI mean you kinda suck as a person overall like a 0/10 also your ugly and your posture is bad you need to fix that it\u2019s good for your spinal health and overall makes you feel better and more confident, but yeah you shouldn\u2019t steal\u201d\n\n\nI made my way around the store picking up every possible box of hard boiled eggs, and also grabbed an energy drink cause I was sleepy. And then I went to perform the maneuver. I strode passionately, arms filled to the brim with eggness, to the front counter.\n\nIt was a gift card. \n\n\nI had completely forgotten my giver of birth had given it to me like 2 months ago, and it had stayed hidden in my wallet until last week in a frantic, anxiety filled search for the rewards card, I found it and my dumb little brain couldn\u2019t read the text that said \u201cgift card\u201d on the bottom.\n\nI\u2019m not going to lie a tear or two fell when the cashier was like \u201calright weirdo, there was $5.29 left on that, now you owe $43.82.\u201d But I sucked it up and paid, and now all I have is sadness and a fair amount of protein and amino acids at only 77 calories per portion.\n\nTL;DR I thought I had it all but now I just have a lot of eggs.\n\nUpdate 2: to everyone saying this is a made up story, I can tell you unfortunately it is not. I wouldn\u2019t be able to eggzagerate something like this.",

        "body": "My wife and I (both mid 30s) have been happily married for nine years. We don't have any kids and don't want kids. We had the \"what if\" talk before getting married; she told me she would want to have an abortion if she ever got pregnant.\n\nYesterday my wife told me she's nine weeks pregnant. She's on the pill, but accidents happen. She said she wants to carry to term and give the baby up for adoption. Naturally, I was surprised by the news and her change of mind. I asked her if she considered getting an abortion. She said she had, but she doesn't want to because she feels a bond to the fetus. She told me she has been researching adoption and learned that the local adoption agencies only accept birth mothers who are okay with having an open adoption. I told her I wasn't really comfortable with this and asked her if she would have an abortion. She started crying and spent the night at her sister's place. She wont answer my phone calls.\n\nI'm uncomfortable with this for a few reasons. I was adopted a birth and my adoptive parents weren't the best. I know this isn't the case for everyone who was adopted, but I can't help but have a negative view about it. A few years ago I tried to find my biological parents to learn my medical history, but I couldn't. I was sore about it for a little while, but it doesn't bother me anymore. My wife is aware of these points.\n\nI just don't want to pass on my genes because they're essentially a mystery to me. I also don't like kids. My wife said she actually would prefer to keep the baby, but she knows I wouldn't want to; so she said having an open adoption sounded like a reasonable compromise. I understand why she thinks that, but I still don't want to have any biological children, regardless of how much/little I would be involved in raising him or her.\n\nAITA for asking my wife to have an abortion?\n\nEdit: my wife takes birth control for reasons other than contraception. If she ever wanted to stop taking it, I would support her 100%. I realize that I\u2019m an idiot for not getting a vasectomy a long time ago though. It honestly never occurred to me until now (I think because my wife has always been on birth control and said she would have an abortion). I see now that it was irresponsible of me to not get one regardless. I\u2019m going to get snipped ASAP.\n\nEdit #2: She and I talked; it was emotional for both of us, but no voices were raised. Here are the main takeaways:\n\n* I apologized for putting her in this position by being an idiot and not getting a vasectomy earlier. I also apologized if she felt like I was pressuring her when I asked her to have an abortion. I didn't mean to pressure her, but I know words aren't always received as we intended. She said she felt pressured a little, but forgave me because she knows I was totally caught off guard.\n* She apologized for having a change of heart regarding abortion. She said she was really surprised by her own feelings and hopes I don't feel like she tricked me (I don't).\n* We mutually agreed that it would be good to spend one more night apart to really think. We've always have a strong marriage, and we're both committed to working through this - whatever that may look like.",

However, I won't deny that it looks a bit odd to most people. I only have my fourth and fifth fingers so my hand looks a bit like a child's drawing of a rabbit, and not a good one.\n\nI'm used to people asking about it, usually after staring for a good minute or two, but I still find it annoying. I really don't get why you'd think it would be an OK thing to ask someone about, but hey. I wasn't raised in a barn. Usually I nip the questioning in the bud by just explaining the truth from the get go and assuming that enough people will gossip about it that the message will spread by the end of the day (it always, always does).\n\nAnyway, I started a new job about a month ago, and I honestly could not face going through that same cycle again. I felt like the time had come to not play into it any more and to make something out of it - and I decided to make myself laugh. When the first new coworker asked about it, I completely lied and told her that I chewed them off as a baby. I then decided to tell the next person who asked that I cut them off with a plastic knife at a picnic, and the next person that I was born with six fingers and they removed too many, and so on. All genuinely ridiculous reasons but I'm a good actor and they actually believed my stupid lies. I didn't expect them to (a plastic knife... through bone?!) but there you go. Maybe they just thought there's no way I'd lie about how I lost my fingers.\n\nWithin about 3 days, I learned that my coworkers had been arguing about the actual reason and it seems like a lot of them now actively dislike me for lying to them. I'm probably going to have to make some cupcakes over the weekend with my super cool 3D printed adaptive whisk to get back into their good books. \n\nAnyway, I told this story to my brother today and he told me that I was an asshole because I caused tension within the office on my first day and made people feel stupid for being gullible and believing my lies. My argument is that I'm not the asshole because they were asking a rude, albeit common, question and because I didn't do it with the intention of deceiving them, I was just honestly fed up of the question and didn't think they'd think I actually severed three fingers with dental floss when I was 3. I'll accept my judgement, though.\n\n",

He\u2019s really goofy with me, and treats me like I\u2019m his little sister and over time I came to agree with him. we are 27 now and still the best of friends. My parents treat him like a son and honestly, he\u2019s family. \n\nA couple months ago I had a ONS and found out I was pregnant. Being as I have PCOS I am OVER THE MOON because I was always told that the chance of me conceiving were very low. I am keeping this gorgeous miracle baby and I cant explain how many tears of relief I shed. I\u2019ve always wanted to be a mom and finally I have a chance at this. I have my own home, have savings, I\u2019m in the right place in life and I\u2019m so happy. \n\nWhen James found out he was also over the moon. He thought it was the coolest thing ever but then gradually dropped off the face of the planet and he never wanted to hang out anymore. Won\u2019t go to the gym with me, is too busy for the cinema, doesn\u2019t feel like going to the mall, can\u2019t come with me to visit mutual friends, nada. \n\nMy mom and dad invite him over every so often for dinner and so at the most recent one I cornered him and asked why he was avoiding me so much and if he had an issue. He confessed that he finds my growing baby bump disturbing and a little gross. He said \u2018I know it\u2019s really weird of me but it just creeps me out\u2019 \n\nI found that so demeaning and hurtful, and I burst out crying and called him an immature asshole and told him to GTFO. He apologized and left and I haven\u2019t heard from him since. I\u2019m so upset that he\u2019s ruining a lifelong friendship over my goddamn baby bump! I want to reach out but I just feel so .... alienated from my own body and made to feel gross and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m the one that\u2019s being difficult or if it\u2019s him.",

I think it\u2019s impossible for someone in my position to see my wife\u2019s point of view fairly so tell me who\u2019s the asshole here. I\u2019m also not interested in any relationship advice, our marriage is fine, it\u2019s solely this topic/argument that I\u2019m interested in hearing your judgement on.\n\nSo my wife and I have two kids together. But before I met my wife I had a daughter with my now ex-wife. My daughter passed away when she was 7, and the emotional toll of this destroyed my marriage with my ex-wife. We haven\u2019t said a word to each other in almost a decade and I have no desire to speak with her anyway.\n\nI still own the same house as then and I\u2019ve pretty much left my daughters room as it was. At first it was just because there was no reason to, but now it\u2019s kind of like a memorial in some weird sense? I can\u2019t really explain the logic behind it because I don\u2019t think there is any. It just doesn\u2019t feel right to change her room.\n\nThis has been the cause of the only arguments my wife and I have really had. The house has four bedrooms, so each of our kids have a room, we have a shared room, and then there\u2019s my daughters old room. My kids know not to go in there and it\u2019s just left there. Occasionally I will go in there and read a book, or just lie down on her bed. It\u2019s therapeutic in some weird way.\n\nMy wife has always wanted to change the room. At first it was because she wanted a study, but I refused and eventually she gave up. \n\nWe\u2019re now talking about having a third child and naturally she wants our new kid to have my daughters old room. Again I put my foot down and said that wasn\u2019t an option, and that our two older kids can share a room instead.\n\n She really blew up at me and told me she was sick of me holding on to the past. She was sick of me being unable to compromise on this. She was sick of feeling like my deceased daughter came first. She said a lot of things but I think that basically sums it up.\n\nWhen she said these things I was really hurt. But I\u2019ve had a few hours to think it over, and I think I might be the unreasonable asshole here. It\u2019s not fair to make my kids share a room because I won\u2019t let go of the past. It\u2019s not fair to have a memorial reminds my wife that she wasn\u2019t my first love. \n\nAITA?",

We are not close, but I congratulated him and moved on with my day. During lunch break, I was part of a larger group conversation, and one of my other coworkers asked Andy for details.\n\nI was shocked when he pulled up a picture of my ex-husband. I blurted something out, and everyone else basically went silent. I explained to Andy that I had been married to Sam, and that he was a serial cheater and had abused painkillers in the past (also true). I ended with saying, \u201c...but if you want to fuck up your life, go ahead and date Sam.\u201d\n\nFast forward to Thursday.

My sister reached out to me the day of the proposal and asked me to be a bridesmaid, which I was ecstatic about. My sister and I are very close, so she said it would be really meaningful to her if I was in the wedding party. I\u2019m really excited for her, and I feel great that she values me enough to give me a spot. \n\nHer and her fiance have been on top of planning everything to avoid stress and pushing things off to the last minute. One of the things they already have picked are the venue and catering. I asked my sister about food options knowing there will likely only be a couple of dishes we can eat, but she told me there won\u2019t be any options for us. Now I\u2019m used to picking from a few side dishes, so I wasn\u2019t expecting a lot, but my sister knows I\u2019m vegan and knew it well before she got engaged. Apparently even the vegetables are going to be very buttery, so we can\u2019t even eat those. I don\u2019t expect a whole vegan friendly wedding, but I\u2019m sure at least one option couldn\u2019t have hurt. \n\nI asked my sister about including at least one thing for me, and she just told me I was probably going to have to find something else to bring in to eat or that I should eat before the wedding so I won\u2019t be hungry when everyone else sits down to eat. Like what? \n\nThis honestly would not be a huge deal if I was going to someone else\u2019s wedding who I wasn\u2019t very close to, but my sister stressed and emphasized so much about how important it was to her that my boyfriend and I be there, then she won\u2019t bother to make sure we can actually eat anything then tells me to just bring something else in while everyone else is catered to. \n\nI understand it\u2019s her wedding. She has enough on her plate already, and I won\u2019t try to make her change the menu for us, but we both feel hurt that we\u2019re just being tossed to the side and told to fend for our own food.\n\nEdit: A piece of info that I did not include is that my parents keep kosher, and they are being provided with options.",

        "body": "Alright everyone, I need some judgement on this one...\n\nMy wife and I have a happy, healthy (no chonkers) cat that we love except for on weekends when he will sit outside our bedroom door and meow non stop until one of us gets up to feed him. This only happens on weekends.\n\nMonday-Friday my wife wakes up for work first at around 6:00 am and feeds the cat. However on weekends we both try to sleep in, so come 6:01 am our kitty alarm clock goes off and won't shut up until one of us gets up to feed him. He will literally cry for 2 hours straight if we try to ignore him.\n\nHere's where the story takes a twist. Awhile back we bought a timed self feeder to use when we are away for vacations. When we tested out the self feeder we discovered the amazing benefit of the cat no longer crying to us for food because he gets fed at his usual time each morning. I thought this was fabulous and we should use the self feeder all the time to save our sleep sanity.\n\nMy wife disagreed. Her reasons range from:\n\nConcerned that the self feeder might not drop the correct amount of food each time.\n\nConcerned the cat might be able to reach his little murder mitten up the food chute and steal extra food between meals.\n\nConcerned the cat won't \"love\" us anymore since we aren't the ones directly pouring his food into his dish.\n\nConcerned it's a waste of batteries.\n\nI've told my wife I understand all of her concerns but I still think the benefit of being able to sleep in without being woken up by a cat banshee outweighs the risks she has laid out. She still disagrees.\n\nSo I did the only thing that reddit hates more in relationships than cheating and gave my wife an ULTIMATUM! \n\nI told her that we either use the self-feeder or come 6:01 am Saturday morning when the cat wakes us both up, I'm kicking her (not litterally) out of bed to go feed the damn cat.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nEDIT: I'm seeing a lot of people proposing the compromise of using the self feeder just on weekends. Unfortunately my wife has shot that idea down in the past too.\n\nEDIT 2: Many people have been demanding I pay the \"cat tax\" and post a picture of the real AH in question. Sadly I am a Reddit failure and can't figure out how to attach a picture to the post. If anyone knows how to do this and can direct message me, I will gladly comply and pay the cat tax.\n\nEDIT 3: Hopefully this works...\n\nMy little AH https://imgur.com/gallery/na99l3J",

        "body": "A bit of backstory. I met my wife in the summer of 2008. She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?",

Yesterday I got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (Barb) house. \n\nI immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since Christmas so I overlooked it and said we (my wife and I ) were in. \n\nWe were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. We all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (Tim) informed the family that his wife (Ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. The affair was with a long time close family friend (Chris) who lived a block away.\n\n\nChris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law Tim. \n\nBoth families have been friends for years. They live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. Honestly, I have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. Hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. \n\nAnyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. \n\nI broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. Saying this was the best april fools gag I've ever seen but I wasn't falling for it. I told Ashley and especially Tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. \n\nBeing the newest member of the family (my wife and I married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. I probably should not have said anything. \n\nEveryone in the room looked horrified. \n\nMy mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. She left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. \n\nTim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. Then berating me for being so insensitive. \n\n\nThe rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...\n\n\nI am still dumbfounded. In hindsight, I probably should have sat in silence... but I honestly still feel like I was calling out an april fools gag. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\n",

Wife hasn\u2019t been too happy since returning to her job from her last maternity leave and I actually just got a new job. \n\nAt my old job I was working 45-50 hours a week. At my new job my hours fluctuate a lot \u2014 it can be anywhere from 60 to 80ish hours a week at the worst. I make a lot more though so there\u2019s that. The pay raise makes it so my family can do really well on just one paycheck. My wife is ecstatic because this means she can be a SAHM which is what she\u2019s wanted. \n\nThe issue is that my wife and I aren\u2019t on the same page about what this change would mean. Before, when our work hours were almost equal, we divided housework pretty much equally. We also paid a housekeeping staff to come every other week to help us out. (Plus we have a nanny to care for our kids while we work). \n\nI told my wife that her staying home would mean no more housekeeping staff or nanny. These cuts will help us afford to have just the one income and I also think it\u2019s practical.  She was mostly agreeable to that. But then she said that we should divide the chores 50-50 still. \n\nI told her there was no way I was going to be taking on as many work hours as I am and then come home to cook or clean too. That would defeat the entire purpose of her quitting her job. \n\nShe looked at me like I was some sort of Neanderthal but I think what I\u2019m saying is completely fair. I\u2019m not expecting her to do any heavy lifting. Just tending to the kids, cooking, and doing a reasonable job keeping up the house. I recognize that this would be an old fashioned way of living and if she ever wanted to return to the workforce I would support her 100%. But I think it\u2019s fair that if I\u2019m the sole paycheck and working crazy hours I don\u2019t come home to more stress and chaos. \n\nObviously my wife and I will have to work this out between ourselves.

So now I feel really awful because I thought it would be really sweet if we reversed the roles because he\u2019s always doing romantic things for me.\n\nAnyway he was sort of cold when we got home, not outwardly aggressive but now I\u2019m just sitting here worried if I did something horribly wrong.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Jesus I didn\u2019t expect this many comments. I see a bunch of people talking about how he lost his chance when he waited 5 years, but I\u2019m only 27 and he\u2019s 28, so we were in college and grad school for much of the relationship. He was getting his PhD and was busy and I got my masters and started my job and he was still in school. We had this conversation maybe 4 months ago? So it\u2019s not like he\u2019s had years.\n\nI\u2019m planning on talking to him about it when he wakes up. But I don\u2019t really appreciate the \u201cyour marriage is doomed\u201d comments\n\nUpdate: I figured I\u2019d update since some of the comments were actually very helpful, despite a few suspect pms. I talked to him earlier, and he apologized for getting upset, I apologized for making him upset and we made up, and then he pulled out an engagement ring for me and proposed back. So all is well, and I still feel a little bad for stealing his  thunder, but these things happen I suppose. But I\u2019m getting married!",

        "body": "Edit/Update:\n\nThe moderators have been kind enough to let me update my post.\n\nI know many, many people have asked about the skillset I mentioned. I just can't be specific because it'll make my younger kids' company identifiable with a quick search. I will say it's nothing mysterious and is a combination of woodworking, metalworking and some masonry sometimes. It's just a niche product and not many people do it. The tools and techniques are unorthodox.\n\nI spent a lot of time reflecting yesterday after reading everyone's comments.\n\nI have talked to my younger kids and I explained to them that even if they aren't happy with how their brother approached it, it's clear he feels left out from our family and it's all our responsibilities to help fix this.\n\nThey agreed to extend the offer of apprenticeship again to their brother where he works and learns as a salaried employee. But they've made it clear that no ownership can be transferred after he's put in at least three years of work like they have. I actually think this is generous because they are paying a salary that they don't need to.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if my oldest will go for this. He is feeling some sort of way about working for his brothers, not with them.\n\nI reached out to a teacher in Alaska who I know casually. He might do me a favor and take on an apprentice. \n\nI need to scrounge up some money and see if I can send my son there. But again, it's Alaska and I'm not sure if my son will be receptive.\n\nI don't know what else I can offer at this point. My wife is disgusted that we've become that family that is fighting about money. She wants to force the twins to give a stake in the company to their brother but I really think it's a bad idea. They need to fix their conflict first or it'll just be a disaster. I don't believe we should be telling our younger kids on how to run their company.\n\nI'll be meeting my son this Friday for dinner. I hope he'll be ok with at least one of the options.\n\nI also need to talk to my parents to stop creating more issues. They've always enjoyed chaos and like pitting people against each other. It's not helping.\n\nThanks everyone.\n\n\nThis is the original story:\n\nThis has quite literally fractured my family.\n\nI have an older son from my first marriage who's now 24. I have two younger kids from my current marriage who are 21 year old twins.\n\nMy divorce occurred right after my son was born. \n\nOver the years, my visitation has been primarily summers and holidays since my ex-wife moved to a different state.\n\nI have a particular skillset I'm was very good at. And all three of my kids have expressed interest in it. Unfortunately, I have only been able to meaningfuly teach it to my younger kids.\n\nThis was because to make my visitation with my older son more memorable, I would do camping/vacations etc. I didn't have time to teach him properly.\n\nAlso, anything I did try to teach him was forgotten and not practised because he lived in an apartment with his mother.\n\nThe major issue now is that my younger kids have started a company after highschool using this skill. I provided the initial funds and as such have a 33% stake in it. This company has really soared this past year and it's making a lot of money.\n\nMy older son graduated from college and is doing a job he hates and is not exactly making a lot of money. Especially compared to his siblings.\n\nPart of this is my fault because he did ask to take a few years off after highschool and maybe have me teach him what I knew but my wife was battling cancer at the time and I told him I couldn't.\n\nAnd now, I'm not well enough to teach anymore.\n\nHe is now telling me to include him in this company as a equal partner. That he'll do the finances.\n\nThis was not received well by his siblings who say they do basically 95% of the work. And that he didn't struggle in the earlier years to get it running.\n\nI'm really at a loss here. I thought of just giving my share of the company to my oldest son but it does seem unfair to his siblings who started this company in the first place.\n\nMy oldest has become very bitter about this and has involved my parents. They are taking his side and now my younger kids are resentful that their grandparents have been turned against them.\n\nOur Sunday family lunches are no longer happening and I'm having to see my oldest for dinner on other days. And everytime I see him I'm getting accused of not treating him fairly. It kills me because I made so many compromises to have him in my life in a meaningful way.\n\nHe accused me on Saturday of pushing him out my new family and loving his siblings more. I haven't been able to sleep since.\n\nShould I have done all this differently?",

I work as a corporate level administrator in the trucking industry.  It's been a pretty sweet gig so far and have no complaints as of yet (2 months in). I would also like to preface the following with saying that I work with a very diverse staff of coworkers who are all as professional as they can be, rarely is it that someone cant pull their own weight. \n\nAbout a week ago I was walking through the parking lot to my car after the end of the day, and I was looking at the sunset through the chain link fence.  As my eyes darted around i happened to notice a pink metal plate bolted onto the fence, I thought to myself \"woah, what's that and how did i not notice it before?\" So i started reading it and I was immediately greeted with slight disappointment.  Basically, it read as follows \"FEMALE EMPLOYEE PARKING SPACE ONLY!\" with a large symbol in the middle of the sign which is also seen on women's public bathrooms.  \n\nNow, let me clarify I am not \"Irate\" or \"fuming\" about it, but I dont really buy into the whole chivalry, white knighting culture that the men of previous generations upheld *fedora intensifies*.  I even asked my fiance when I got home, just to get a female insight on it.  She said she thought it was stupid.  I guess I'm just coming from the territory of you can show that your a diverse company dedicated to equality, without making tedious or unimportant decisions like special parking.  Just my two cents on it though. ",

You must score at least a 508 to be in the top 20% of applicants, in a field where only about 20% of applicants each year accepted into all the med schools in the country.\n\nResults for the June 15 exam came out yesterday.

I'm 25.\n*  I don't know if I'm going to abort, however *if* I do carry the baby full term, I'd rather take care of it myself and not give it up for adoption.\n*  I'm in New York which has some of the toughest grandparent rights laws which further complicates things. I'm afraid of giving birth then having custody taking away from me.\n*  My financial situation is... okay. I can support my baby and I if I budget down.\n*  My relationship with my in-laws was never friendly. They didn't approve of me and despite trying to warm relations with them they never reciprocated.\n*  Some people are questioning why I'm trying to move on so fast and saying I'm awful for it: The baby is growing and I can't hit pause.

        "body": "I'm getting a major surgery done in about three weeks and I was told there's a 60-80% chance it will kill me. It's 60% if I do all the things the surgeon told me to do to prepare for the surgery (take supplements, gain weight fast, lots of protein) and I'm following all the rules. So let's say my chances of dying are 60%. That's not great but not too horrible.\n\nThe thing is that I've had this exact surgery before and I came out just fine so my family has no reason to think this time will be any different (aside from the risk involved with any surgery). However for reasons involving My Medical Condition (TM), this time the surgery is riskier.\n\nMy family consists of my older brother (28M) who I (27M) live with and my mom (54F) who lives on the other side of the country. My brother is very protective of me and my mom still acts like I'm her little boy. The only reasons I could think of to tell them would be:\n\n1. Give them time to prepare for the possibility of my death. BUT I don't think this is something they can prepare for. I'm sure they'd just be miserable for the time leading up to the surgery. I don't want that.\n2. Give us all a chance to make happy memories before the surgery. Again I don't think that can happen when we'd only be doing it because I might die soon. It would feel forced and desperate and they would only be pretending to not be miserable and I'd be unhappy because I would know they're miserable.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"ignorance is bliss\" for everyone involved. If I survive, no harm done and all that potential misery would be for nothing. If I die, well that's a risk of any surgery and their final moments with me wouldn't have had that misery. And with My Medical Condition (TM) it's unlikely I'd make it to retirement age anyway.\n\nBut is it right for me to hide something this big, even if it's to spare them pain? What are your thoughts?\n\nEDIT: The surgery is 100% necessary. I WILL die without it, but it would take maybe a year or so and be very unpleasant.\n\nEdit2: I've already gone over how I'd want my body dealt with the last time I had surgery (donated to science or cremated if science doesn't want it). I have no debts and my brother knows about all my bank accounts.\n\nEdit3: I will write letters to them.\n\nEdit4: Maybe I wasn't very clear about this because a few people have commented about it. I'm not hiding the surgery itself from my family, just how risky it is. They're going to come see me off and we'll say our I love yous and good lucks at the hospital.\n\nEdit5: I already have an advanced medical directive from the last time I had this surgery.\n\nAnd YES I promise to post an update if I survive! You're all very sweet for wishing me well. It turns out Reddit isn't as scary as I feared (I just joined and this is my first post).\n\nEdit6: Thanks to everyone who responded with their thoughts! I honestly don't know what I want anymore. There seems to be no good answer and spending the last 4 hours reading what everyone has said and thinking about my upcoming surgery has left me feeling pretty drained. I'm going to take a break and recharge.\n\nEDIT7: Okay I'm feeling very overwhelmed here. I was only expecting to get 10 comments, maybe 20 at the most. Now there's nearly 400 comments. I wrote this post feeling pretty confident of my decision but I wanted to see if anyone out there had a different perspective, another point of view that I hadn't considered. After reading over 100 of these comments I don't know what I should do anymore. I'm feeling guilty for hiding this but I can't see what the right thing to do is. There probably *isn't* a right thing to do.\n\nSo many of you have shared their stories and experiences with the death of a loved one. I'm truly sorry you had to go through that and I appreciate your perspectives. I'm going to revisit this in the morning and look at this with fresh eyes.\n\nPS: To all the people who are setting reminders for three weeks (a bit morbid but I understand) you should make it for four weeks. If I survive, I'll need time to recover and get out of the ICU before I come back to Reddit.",

My boss told them that I am one of the top account managers in our unit and asked me what advice I can give the new hires on how to succeed at this job.\n\nI said that our job is 30% work and 70% luck, sometimes you get big deals with minimal effort and sometimes you give it everything you have but the deal still doesn\u2019t push through. But what\u2019s important is to have good relationships with your co-workers because work is much easier when you have a positive work environment.\n\nAfter the meeting my boss talked to me and he was not happy about the advice I gave. He said that he wanted the new hires to see me as a role model but instead I embarrassed him by encouraging them to be complacent since I said that 70% of the job is luck. He said that I know the advice I should give them is to set goals and work hard to achieve them as their careers are just beginning but I went with trying to sound cool instead of giving them the best advice.\n\nI specifically avoided telling the new hires that they should work hard because I don\u2019t work hard myself and everyone else in the room knows that. I\u2019m not humble bragging. I was always an average employee, I just got lucky these past three years because even without asking my clients brought me their friends who also ended up doing business with me so the deals basically just fell into my lap. But even now I have a lot of lazy days where I procrastinate or I go on sudden leaves just because I don\u2019t feel like working.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to be that person who doesn\u2019t practice what she preaches, but should I have told them what they needed to hear instead of what I really wanted to say?\n\nEdit: Wow this blew up.\n\nThank you to everyone who is worried that I might get fired or I won't be promoted because of what I said, thankfully promotions in our company depend on your performance. We have guaranteed merit increases as long as we meet their our budgets, and if you go over your budget you get a bigger increase. Unless I do something against company policies or I don't meet my budget for three straight years my boss also can't recommend my termination. Even then it's not my immediate boss who decides if I get fired, so I think I'm pretty safe.\n\nI still believe that a big part of my achievements in the past three years is down to luck. I didn't do anything different than what I did the past five years. I was nice and accommodating to my clients before but they didn't refer any deals or the ones they did did not push through. I don't know what changed these last three years. But the reality is that the clients came to me and from there I just had to type some templated proposals.\n\nIn contrast I have coworkers who bust their ass marketing new clients on their own, they have good relationships with their existing clients but do not get referrals, or they make somersaults to sort out terms and conditions to make a deal happen but the client suddenly says he doesn't need the deal anymore. That's why I think that I've been lucky and I know this luck is not gonna last forever.\n\nBut I see your point that maybe I shouldn't have said what I did at a formal meeting like that in front of my boss.",

My brother has a girlfriend, also 18, who is over a lot. They are fully consenting adults, therefore they do things that I don't want to think about.\n\nThey always shower/bathe together, and because the bathroom shares a wall with my bedroom and the kitchen, no matter where I go in the flat I hear exactly what they're doing. Then the shower stops running and my brother leaves, and exactly 10 minutes later, often to the exact second, the girlfriend leaves. She spends the 10 minute interim playing games on her phone.\n\nThe reason for this is that she doesn't want me to see them leave the bathroom together. She is unaware of the sound issue and thinks that I have no idea they even entered the bathroom together, and hopes that 10 minutes will be enough for me to believe that my brother had his shower and left and then she entered and had hers separately.\n\nHowever, this 10 minute pause between them finishing in the bathroom and her leaving the bathroom is a real pain in the arse.

        "body": "Hi. Made a new throwaway account to post this because I am... wildly conflicted right now.\n\n**Backstory:** My sister (4 years younger than me) and her husband have been married \\~2yr, together for 5. BIL and I dated during high school, and it ended under circumstances that were not ideal. BIL and I have not gotten along since he and sister got together. My sister essentially believes I'm jealous of her for marrying my \"one who got away\" (he is not that), so our relationship has ALSO suffered as a result. This whole situation is already fucked up and yes, I'm pretty sure it's putting my therapist's kid through college, but that's not the problem right now.\n\nRecently BIL has begun reaching out to me more frequently. I've been very cautious but after talking it over with people in my own life, chose to be more friendly toward him as part of an attempt at repairing certain aspects of my relationship with the entire family. Last week BIL asked if I would read a book he had written, with the underlying implication that I would help him career-wise with his aspirations as a writer. Out of politeness and curiosity, I said sure, thinking I would perhaps get a good laugh out of it and a story to tell my publishing friends.\n\nThe book... is about us. I don't know how else to put it. It's a \"domestic thriller\" (so think *Gone Girl, You,* etc.) about a man who realizes he has married \"the wrong sister\" and becomes obsessed with his SIL. It's one of the weirdest things I have ever seen. It doesn't exactly read like a manifesto, more like something you'd see on r/menwritingwomen, but aspects of the story were deeply unsettling to me personally (touching on things that happened to me in high school and later), and I don't understand why he would give this to me to read unless he wanted to either creep me out, or - as in the story - he intends to leave my sister and wanted to see if this would... Jesus, it's too weird to say. Open a door with me?\n\nHere's how I'm conflicted. People have always used art as a form of cathartic healing. If a stranger handed me this book, I would just say \"not my taste\" and move on. That said, this is my sister's husband, and I found certain elements so skin-crawlingly uncomfortable that I almost didn't finish it. That ALSO said, this is my sister's husband, and I am afraid, based on the past, that if I tell her about this, she will flip out on me and not him, and/or if she confronts him, he will also just lie about the whole thing? And on the off-chance that it's more than just tasteless catharsis, I don't want my sister to get turned into a skin suit? (There are no skin suits but you get it.) And if it IS just a fictional fantasy thriller, I'll either look like a paranoid asshole or the lawmakers who tried to ban video games after Columbine.\n\n**TLDR: My BIL and I dated in high school and he wrote a really creepy novel about being obsessed with me and I don't know whether to tell my sister for the shitstorm it could cause.**\n\n**EDIT: Whew. Went to dinner and came back to a lot more replies than when I left. I'm figuring out a way to move forward right now. Thanks to everyone who has commented, I've read them all.**",

        "body": "So I (26m) don\u2019t like kids, I never have, and was always adamant that I would never have kids.  So much so that when I was 22 I wanted to get a vasectomy.  The doctor told me to wait and think it over since I was so young, but I eventually got one when I was 24.  It went well, and test results at the time showed I had no sperm count. \n\nMy girlfriend of three years also said she never wanted kids (wanting kids would be a dealbreaker for me) and I thought that was it and we\u2019d be child free.  Well a last week she found out she was pregnant and we were both in shock.  Between my vasectomy and her being on birth control (for non-pregnancy related reasons) the odds of her getting pregnant should be astronomically low.  We couldn\u2019t believe she was pregnant, and my gf assured me she didn\u2019t cheat and was willing to take a dna test to prove it (if that\u2019s possible at this stage) and I believe her.  I also went back to the doctor to get a sperm count, and somehow a small amount of sperm were present and there would be a small chance I could get someone pregnant.  \n\nNow I don\u2019t want the kid, and was under the assumption she didn\u2019t either.  She says she assumed she would get an abortion if she was pregnant, but actually being pregnant is different and she\u2019s having second thoughts.  While I strongly want her to get an abortion, I realize that it\u2019s ultimately her choice, but I told her that if she does go through with the pregnancy (and doesn\u2019t adopt it), I want nothing to do with it.  I\u2019d do whatever I legally have to do in terms of child support, but I won\u2019t be involved with raising the kid.  Also our relationship would effectively be over because I don\u2019t want to be with someone who has a kid.  My friends and brother think I\u2019m a complete asshole and that I should suck it up if she chooses to have the kid.  I think I took reasonable, if not extreme precautions to ensure I never had to worry about a kid and that I shouldn\u2019t have to raise a kid I don\u2019t want as long as I fulfill my legal obligations.  So reddit, AITA for not wanting to raise my kid?\n\nEdit: to all the people saying the kid isn\u2019t mine, she offered (unprompted) to take a dna test.  Along with my sperm test results and having no reason to suspect she\u2019d cheat, I fully expect that the child would be mine.\n\nEdit 2: thank you to everyone who has responded.  After further discussion with my gf, she is set on having the baby and is slightly against adoption, but considering it.  She still wants me to be in her life, even if our relationship is over and it\u2019s just as friends.  If she has the baby, I\u2019d treat it the same as I do my friends kids; I\u2019d be friendly towards them but have no interest in raising them, just with the addition of child support. We are planning to get a dna test done as well.",

If she didn\u2019t enjoy that, it\u2019s just idk wrong.  \n\nShe cried when I said I don\u2019t think I can have a relationship without sex.   Like sobbed.   She said that\u2019s why she never told me. \n\nI asked her how she saw our relationship progressing.  She was really adamant that we could make it work.  That we could even have kids.   But as far as sex I could just get sex toys. \n\nA relationship with her on her terms really just sounds like friends with a kid.   I already have friends.   I don\u2019t want to have a kid with them.   \n\nShe\u2019s super emotional right now, I don\u2019t know how to deal with it honestly.  Her friendship relationship doesn\u2019t work for me. ",

        "body": "I made the terrible mistake of watching a medical drama with my pregnant wife. We\u2019ve been binging House M.D. and of course there\u2019s a pregnancy complication episode where a dad is asked to choose between the baby and the mother (the mother was going to die either way it was just a little quicker). My wife said that she\u2019d want me to choose the baby if it came to that. I told her there was no fucking way I would do that, we could have another baby but I could never have another her. She got all mad and questioned my commitment to being a father and I said I\u2019m committed to being a father but I\u2019m more committed to being a husband. This argument went on forever.  I told her that if she was brain dead or was going to die either way I would choose the baby but otherwise it\u2019s her She said basically said what she wants over and over and I said I\u2019m not spending another 50 or years without her. This is all because I love her more than anything else in the world. We\u2019re still in disagreement over this completely hypothetical situation. Before anyone asks: yes it has occurred to me I can just lie because chances are this will never happen but it just feels wrong to lie about it.\n\nAITA?",

        "body": "I have a 11 month old baby. Super awesome little dude. I also have a 10 year old daughter from a previous marriage. I raised her as a single dad from 18 months to the present. \n\nI've been very careful to not tell my wife how to do things or how I did them in the past because she's excited to have the  experience of a baby and she's expressed things like \"you've done this before. This is my only chance to have a baby.\" (I got the snipsnip shortly after he was born). Basically I don't want to Dadsplain parenting. \n\nThis has led to things that I personally think are potentially problematic (ie she won't do cry it out even though the doc said it's time) BUT I'm happy to let her have her way so long as lil dude is healthy and safe. (Yes we've talked about it and she knows where I stand on it. That's not what I'm worried about being an asshole about) \n\nSo the other day, I'm putting his shoes on and she tells me, \"be sure they're on the right feet.\" Or while giving him a bath \"be sure to clean his diaper area well.\" \n\nDUUUUUUUUUDE. I KNOOOOOOOOOOW.\n\n\nAnd it's been like that since the beginning. \"you've got to support his head.\" \" You swaddle him too tight\" ( I didnt. That shit's supposed to make then immobile).\n\nLike I said. I want her to enjoy the ride. But I kept a kid alive for a decade almost entirely by myself. I don't need to be told how to put a pair of shoes on a baby or any other obvious shit. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I told her \"you know I know what I'm doing, right?\"",

        "body": "My daughter (15) is 5'6 and the last time she weighed herself at the doctor's office she was at 238lbs. She is morbidly obese.\n\nShe was always a chubby kid who loved food and hated activity no matter how much her dad and I tried to get her to dance, play sports, go on walks with our dog etc. she would refuse. I regret not taking her to a nutritionist earlier, but I thought that she would go into puberty and her weight would eventually be okay. Unfortunately, when she was 11 her dad and I decided to get a divorce. No special reason, it just wasn't working. We coparent well, we're friendly, we go on trips with out daughter etc., but the divorce impacted her negatively at first. \n\nShe started gaining a lot of weight around that time so we decided to take her to a nutritionist who recommended therapy for her. She initially lost about 15lbs but she was already very dependent on food. Now, she's a food addict. Her emotional eating was something she used to cope with the divorce until she adjusted, but now it's all about compensating for not having friends, compensating for not being ''pretty'', compensating for not being liked by boys etc. \n\nShe still goes to therapy regularly, she doesn't suffer from depression or another health condition that might cause her weight gain, she is simply addicted to food and at her vulnerable age, mentioning her weight to her makes her very upset and uncomfortable. Her dad and I both know this and it's been causing arguments between us. I'm a very active, fit person and I try to lead by example - no junk food allowed in the house, I cook as much as I can or I get healthy meal delivery - and this makes me the bad guy.\n\nShe's into the whole body acceptance movement and she sold the story to her dad who now allows her to raid his pantry and they eat junk together just so he wouldn't upset her because she's daddy's little girl. He's happy that he gets to be the good guy and I'm the villain who doesn't want her daughter to settle because I want her to live past 35. I encourage her to love herself, I want her to embrace how amazing she is but I don't want her to accept her condition as something normal that can't be changed. I'm tired seeing how miserable she is because of her weight and I'm tired of thinking about all the diseases that could kill her. \n\nI found a great weight management treatment facility (*\n\nAITA?\n\n__EDIT:__ Lots of repetitive question and comments. Please look through my comment history, thank you.\n\n__EDIT2:__ Again, I've explained everything about this treatment facility, her current therapy and approach to her eating disorder, the fact that the choice is ultimately hers, yes we do have a dog and no she doesn't want to walk him, no this isn't a quick fix, no I don't think my daughter hates me.\n\n__EDIT3:__ I sound like a broken record, put please read through my comments before asking the same things over and over! There's a word limit here and obviously not everything fits in the post. The facility does have therapists, specialists, doctors and all types of health professionals. They do have ED programs that she would be a part of and she would be in touch with her current therapist because she has a hard time opening up to new people, so that would help her. I double and triple checked everything and talked to so many parents and employees, but it's ultimately her choice. My fear is that her dad will cloud her judgment by bribing her with food.\n\n__EDIT4:__ Thank you guys for all of your responses. I've received a lot of great advice, your own experience with ED, personal stories, support and empathy. I appreciate all of it. I'll no longer be replying to comments because I find myself trying too hard to reach people who are twisting my words and using them against me. Maybe I'll post an update within the next few weeks when something happens, but things definitely will change around here. Again, thank you all!",

Also, I'm French, so my English is average at best.\n\nWe lost our 14 yo daughter to cancer( I don't want to discuss that here ) a couple of years ago. These two years have been very difficult for us. Though I've learned to cope up, nothing can ever replace her. \n\nMy wife attended a support group, where she ended up befriending another woman, whose 11yo daughter had the same cancer our daughter had and they became close friends. Her daughter survived. We are really happy for her. She and her daughter visit us sometimes. \n\nLast time, when her daughter was here, she came across my daughter's custom made neclace which I made for her( I'm a jewellery designer by profession ). She saw it in a small room in which we made a small memorial for our daughter. It has her pictures, belongings and all her favourite things. She really liked it and asked my wife about it. \n\nNow, after they left, my wife asked me if I can make the same one for the girl. My wife told me that the girl really liked the neclace and asked if she could have one. I told her that it was something I made for my daughter and I don't want to share that or make it for anyone. No one can replace her. My wife thinks that our daughter would be really happy if we shared her memory with someone who had similar struggles and that I'm being selfish. AITA here?",
