One of the girls had picked out a pair of VERY expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. Second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she\u2019s really gonna spend that much on boots. Girl with boots says something along the lines of \u201cit\u2019s fine I have my dads credit card I\u2019m not paying \u201d which instantly caught my attention because THATS NOT HER CARD. I\u2019ve told my son multiple times he\u2019s never allowed to use my card so I\u2019m interested to see how this girl thinks she\u2019s going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else.\n\nWe end up at the same register (me behind) and I see her total hit well over four digits. The girl is about to swipe her card when I decide that I can\u2019t let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. I tell cashier that isn\u2019t her card but her father\u2019s and I\u2019m not sure she has permission. Girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look I\u2019ve ever seen. I swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, I don\u2019t think she was ever told no.\n\nGirl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it\u2019s the stores credit card and it gives him the points. Now that I\u2019ve pointed out it wasn\u2019t hers cashier tells her she can\u2019t use that card. Girl tries to show ID to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and I tell her it\u2019s still fraud. Girl says it\u2019s not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. I tell her that it is my business that she\u2019s doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or I call the cops. Girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. She uses her own card and leaves crying. Cashier looks mad at me and I tell my husband when I get home only for him to agree I was in the wrong.",

His job is a high paying one for a new grad, about \\~90k with commission and base so we expect a lot from this position. Because of the accident we let him take a 1 month paid leave of absence from work and he's returned a few weeks ago and his performance is severely lacking. He's super unmotivated, not cold calling, out reaching to prospects for the last 2-3 weeks enough since he's come back. Our whole mgmt team has noticed this and we decided to let him go because we feel like he'd need months and months to be able to produce again and we can't just wait that long.\n\nWe called him into a meeting on Friday afternoon and gave him the bad news, he was very calm and rude about it. Told us to go fuck ourselves and got up and went to his desk grabbed his few things and left.

        "body": "My wife is pregnant with our daughter. Initially we were really happy and excited about it. But then, she starts acting like a nut job. She gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food I make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.\n\nFor example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. Well, I made chicken sandwiches. So she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. I wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. But if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? When I asked her this she told me that she was hungry. Ok fine. She does this every time. Eats everything I make and calls it shit. I don't argue with her because I work for more than 80 hours a week and I really want to have some peace when I'm home.\n\nSo, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if I wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. I rejected her and told her that I was married. And when I got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. When I asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty. So they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out. And I passed. Yay!!. I'm really pissed. I'm done with her antics.",

I figured while I wait for a text, I could post here to see if what I did was really that bad. \n\nI'm a big fat ass, there's no way around it. I love to eat which probably borders on addiction but I figure since I'm only hurting myself it's probably better to just live my life. I have some great friends although there is no doubt I'm the \"harmless, funny token fat guy\" of the otherwise pretty good looking group. I guess that sets the stage enough. \n\nLast night my friend hosted UFC and I was invited. He got a 6 foot party sub. I also brought homemade wings that are sort of my specialty. Well of course people flocked to the food and I had basically one serving of the sandwich but people devoured my wings and I didn't get to have a single one. Which is totally fine that's why I brought them but maybe an hour later I was starving. I kept eyeing the sandwich and I'd say there was about 3 feet of it left. I waited an hour, then another half hour and no one had touched it (but they were still munching on chips, pretzels and what not). So I was like screw it...I took about half of what was left and ate it. Then the last half sat for another 10-15 minutes and no one said anything so ate the rest. \n\nWell to be sure as I was swallowing the last bite the host's girlfriend asked where the sandwich was. Like I was the guilty party pretty much everyone pointed at me. I guess they'd noticed me eating the sandwich. She was furious and said that I was an incredible pig and that I had been super selfish to eat 3 feet of a sandwich. I felt so bad I tried to explain to her that I really did wait over an hour and thought people had lost interest. I also tried to explain how everyone had ate my wings and she said something along the lines of \"you brought them to share Alan, if someone had eaten over half by themselves that's not fucking sharing is it?\" \n\nI offered to order pizza or even go get subways and she said that it was a pathetic offer because the party sub had been from a local shop owned by her friends. I said I was sorry but the night was so tense from then on out. \n\nI woke up this morning to several texts from my twin sisters (the host's girlfriend's best friends) saying that I had to get my shit under control and that everyone is really mad at me and that I embarrassed myself last night. I tried to explain to them what my mindset had been and they haven't responded. \n\nWas I the asshole for eating that much of the sandwich last night?",

        "body": "I have waited tables for the last three years.\n\nDuring my shift last night, a group of four women in their late 20s came in. They were a pleasure to have as customers. They ordered four of our house cocktails to start with and then went over the menu for their entrees. \n\nWhen I was on my way back to their booth with the drinks on a tray, I walked by the back side and overheard one of them talking about how she was 14 weeks along. When I rounded back, they were talking about the same topic and it was clear to me that she was pregnant. I figured her having one drink wasn't a big deal. They ordered their entrees and I went off to handle other tables.\n\nAbout five minutes later, they called me over again and asked for another round. At this point I started getting concerned, but I took the order and cheerfully said I'd be right back. This time, I went to the bartender, and asked him to make one of them a virgin cocktail. He was confused but since he's a good friend of mine, I told him to just trust me. \n\nA few cocktails later (hers strictly virgin) they started getting rowdy, and Mrs. Pregnant Woman was also getting into it. I figured that since she didn't notice, things were OK. The problem came when I took them their check, and they asked to split the bill at the register. When Mrs. Pregnant Woman got to the counter, I saw her cocktails were marked with (virgin). My bartender had edited each in the system for inventory.\n\nIt was too late for me to edit them back, so I just had her pay, hoping that she wouldn't look at the receipt. They all thanked me and left, leaving a generous tip in the process. They were talking in the parking lot for the next short while, presumably waiting for an Uber.\n\nSeveral minutes later Mrs. Pregnant Woman came back and asked what (virgin) on the receipt meant. I fessed up that it meant non-alcoholic. She blank stared me for a few seconds and then asked if she had ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail. I said no, but told her that I assumed she wanted one seeing as she was pregnant. It was a lame lie and I'll admit it, but she looked me in the eye and asked me to return her part of the tip. I did so. Then she talked to my manager. My manager took me into her office and literally shrieked at me until hoarse. \n\nI stood my ground and told her that I'm not going to be responsible for FAS. She told me that she was taking me off the calendar until she decided what to do with me. She also informed me that I could get the restaurant in serious trouble for discrimination, and upon examination of my state's laws, she is correct. \n\nBut when I talked to my mother and father about it tonight, they told me that they understood my position. The entire staff at the restaurant is against me and I think that I'm going to call in and tell my manager that I quit, but I still feel in the right here. I would like some perspective on this and if I'm the asshole here.",

I fell in love and married a Muslim man and had to convert to his religion. My family was pretty pissed off that I converted but we've kept in touch.\n\nRecently my sister announced that she was in love with a guy she'd met while trekking and they had plans to marry. My mom invited me for a 'girl's day', just me, her and my sister at my parent's home for a fun day.\n\nMy sister began to talk about her fiance, how they hated each other at first but then fell in love etc etc. I was happy for her.\n\nIt all began when I asked what religion he was.

This would mean that it would make my father absolutely over the moon.\n\nI asked her if she was sure she loved him, because it seemed unbelievable that she would meet someone from the same small community as our parents' and fall in love. She got angry and told me that she was absolutely sure she was in love with him. \nI suggested that maybe she thought she was in love because it was easy and there was no challenges involved.\n\nI explained to her that if she was truly in love, she wouldn't choose someone so obviously a match. It was as though our parents chose him from a catalogue. \n\nShe told me that it didn't matter, she loved him and thats it, and I was being rude. I told her that I wasn't, I was just looking out for her and didn't want her to bear the brunt of societal expectations on who to marry.  I then asked her if she was marrying him to appease our parents.\n \nAt this point my sister blew up on me and began fuming that she was not a kid, she didn't need to appease anyone etc etc. At this point my mom told me(not her) to get out of the house.\n\n\nLater my sister told me never to contact her again, nor ever see her face or come to her wedding.

I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.\n\nI met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.\n\nSo pardon my french, but what the fuck?",

We get there and it seems like one of those hipster places but whatever, I\u2019m hungry. \n\nI look at the menu and this place is crazy expensive - like every dish is more than $15-$20 and half the ingredients I\u2019ve never heard of. I order the bison steak ($26) and my girlfriend orders some weird pasta, noki I think ($18). Very important, these were listed as ENTREES on the menu. Mind you with drinks plus tip this is going to come out to over $60 which is already ridiculous for dinner for two people.\n\nSo anyway we order as we are starving. My steak arrives and I am shocked, it\u2019s like 6 small pieces of sliced steak with some weird sauce on the side and a small handful of salad. I joke to the waiter \u201cwhere\u2019s the rest of my steak?\u201d and he explains they serve smaller portions at this restaurant because they focus on getting the highest quality ingredients. I don\u2019t care if this bison was blessed by the pope himself it\u2019s absurd to charge that much for such a small bit of steak, it\u2019s highway robbery. When I go to restaurants I expect an entree to fill me up and be enough for leftovers.\n\nI\u2019m complaining to my girlfriend and she\u2019s getting annoyed with me. Similar situation with her pasta it was like maybe 12 pieces of noki dressed up with some frou frou bullshit. Granted the food was pretty good but I can not get over how tiny these portions are. I\u2019m a big guy and I like to eat, what can I say. \n\nWhen the waiter comes back I inform him we will not be paying for our meal, and that they are falsely advertising entrees that barely qualify as a light snack. My girlfriend is begging me to stop but that\u2019s where we\u2019re different, I don\u2019t let businesses push me around and rip me off. \n\nA manager comes and apologizes but asks us to leave. I don\u2019t end up paying as they realized I called them out on their bullshit. My girlfriend is silent the entire time on the way back. Im still hungry so I drive through McDonald\u2019s and get a burger, and when I did that she asked to be dropped off at her place. It\u2019s now the next day and I\u2019m starting to think I didn\u2019t handle the situation as well as I could have (I could have probably just asked for a discount).

Of the three, two were the same skin tone as her husband, and the third was much darker.

She didn\u2019t even listen or answer rationally, she just freaked out at me and acted super insulted and kicked me out. I reached out to her husband and told him about her reaction and told him he should get a paternity test and he called me an asshole and blocked me. Neither has spoken to me since.\n\nI\u2019ve always thought that they dramatically over reacted and were probably hiding something because of their responses, but they\u2019re still married and sometimes I feel bad about what happened.

        "body": "My ex husband and I share custody of our 10 year old daughter and 12 year old son. We have a 2-2-3 schedule which usually looks like I have the kids Friday after school and then he gets them Monday after school. I get them back Wednesday after school and then he gets them Friday after school and then the week flip flops. We've done this since our divorce 5 years ago and it works well. I'm a nurse in the OR so I schedule my shifts for the days during the week when they are with their dad and my one call weekend every 6 weeks is a weekend they are with their dad. \n\nRecently, the kids said they want to try splitting up on the weekends, so instead of both of them being with one us during the weekend, one will go with dad and one will be with me. My son said he would make sure he was with me on call weekends because he can stay by himself if I have to get called in or can hang out at the hospital until I'm done. My ex is on board with this because he says it will allow us to spend one on one time with the kids and will allow the kids a break from each other (they squabble occasionally and annoy one another). While they have a point- sometimes it is hard to not feel like you are disappointing one by trying to accommodate the other, I do not want to give up my free weekends. It took me a few months to get used to not having my kids all the time after the divorce but now my weekends without them are filled with activities or travel. My ex agreed if there was a weekend trip I wanted to take he would be fine having both the kids that weekend but I honestly don't want to have to take his schedule into consideration when planning my trips, and sometimes they are spontaneous trips. \n\nI was talking to my family about this at breakfast this morning and they are all kind of appalled by me not wanting to do this. My sister pointed out that if I was still married, then I wouldn't have all the child free time I have now and many mothers don't get a break from their kids like I do. My mom said she can't believe I'd deny my children quality time with their parents for selfish reasons like not wanting to give up my weekends. My SIL seemed to understand where I was coming from but said that she would still do it and just incorporate the child into whatever I was doing and pointed out my daughter would love to go on the NYC shopping trip I had planned for December and my son would happily join me for my Saturday morning spin classes. I considered that but my SIL loves taking her kids everywhere so I don't know that she is aware of how nice it is to just be an adult without the responsibility of a child wherever you go. They were really making me feel like an asshole though.",

        "body": "We were at a local restaurant last Saturday evening. This is a locally owned establishment, not a chain. There was a 30-45 minute wait for tables.  There was another family waiting in the wait area, and the \"mom\" went to the bar and came back with three drinks. A beer for \"dad\" and a margarita for her and one of the young women. There was another young woman there who looked of college age, and had on a college sorority t-shirt, but no drink was brought for her.\n\nBut as I watched I noticed that the mom was sharing her margarita with the 4th girl, who I assumed was under 21 as she had no drink of her own. In fact, I'd guess the 4th girl consumed MOST of the mom's margarita. I mentioned this to my husband and he said so what, forget it. Full disclosure that I'm a non drinker myself and certainly don't approve of underage drinking, not to mention that this behavior might put the restaurant at risk. So I mentioned it to the hostess. A short time later a manager (I assume) came and asked to see the girls' ID's. The girl with her own drink produced one. The second girl who had been drinking from Mom's drink did not.  I did not hear the exchange, but the family left thereafter. I assume they were asked to do so. \n\nMy husband said that it was a crappy thing for me to do. I feel like I was protecting the restaurant. Was I the Asshole?",

He's a shift manager but it's not a real formal thing, he's a friendly guy.\n\nDanielle - A college student who sometimes works weekends too.\n\nSo sometimes customers will come in and just be angry about such little stuff. Like literally blow up about nothing. I dunno if theyre in a bad mood already and looking for someone to take it out on or what, but it's a lot... Like how sad so your have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on high school and college kids.\n\nSo James and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs.\n\nSo one day I was at work and some guy was having a temper about how we don't make the coffee hot enough... Which I couldn't do a thing about because I gave it to him right out of the machine.\n\nSo James came in and was like \"sir is there a problem here\" and the guy started ranting at him too. So he was just like \"OP, this is unacceptable, you're fired.\" \n\nI started acting real sad, like \"no please don't fire me, my family needs the money, I need this job, pleaseeee\" and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off my apron and leave.\n\nThe angry guy started to backtrack, like \"It isn't that big of a problem, you don't need to fire her over it. I didn't mean it\" and James was like \"No, we pride ourselves on the best customer service\"\n\nOf course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we've done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Danielle or I, James will storm in and \"fire\" us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn't mean it. It's kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences. \n\nAnyway, I was telling my friends from school about this and a few of them thought it was a mean prank, to let someone go away thinking they'd gotten someone who desperately needs the money fired.",

This year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and I jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. We learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, I adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc. \n\nNone of this has been a problem for me until recently. She saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then I rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. She exploded in anger (teen years, I\u2019m not too fussed about the anger explosion, I know she doesn\u2019t mean it) and said that that was HER pan for vegan food. I was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it\u2019s not YOUR pan. \n\nShe asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. I didn\u2019t want her to feel weird about food, so I said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. The reason they\u2019re colored is so it helps me remember that I\u2019m not to touch them unless I\u2019m cooking vegan. \n\nThat wasn\u2019t good enough. Now apparently the dishwasher is \u2018contaminated\u2019 with animal product, and the fridge has \u2018bacon grease fingers\u2019 on it (because I eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she\u2019s asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. I don\u2019t mean I literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because I wash my hands, but it\u2019s clearly enough that it upsets my daughter. \n\nfrankly I\u2019m on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. My wife\u2019s reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn\u2019t want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. My daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it\u2019s specifically meat products that make her feel sick. Now I\u2019m sorry for her, but I feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because I\u2019m not going to stop eating bacon in my own house.",

She was flying here constantly to visit him, like a weekend a month and he didn\u2019t lift a finger to go visit her. \n\nI tried talking to him about it several times and told him he should really start looking into flying over to her instead of expecting her to do all the travelling. He said no. And my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. I spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he\u2019d have to fly over to her country too. Which is fair enough. \n\nHe said no, he didn\u2019t want to fly or travel anywhere. My son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc. \n\nLast week, he told us she\u2019s dumped him. I went on her fb page as we\u2019re all still friends (she wrote us an apology letter about how she\u2019s upset it didn\u2019t work out but these things happen, so we\u2019re on good terms) and looks like she\u2019s with a new guy already. Me and my wife have no doubt she was seeing him whilst still in a relationship with my son. \n\nI confessed to them both that I actually agree with her decision and he should have expected it. He did not treat her properly and I hope he learns lessons for the next one because he needs to make more of an effort. I said he deserves it for his lack of effort in the relationship and for essentially just allowing this girl to spend all her money and time coming here all the time. \n\nWife and son are very upset that I said this.

He gets a lot of attention from girls and for the most part, doesn't seem to get that they're flirting with him. I'm not generally annoyed by this, and never really say anything.\n\nHowever, there's one girl in our class, let's call her Victoria, who is obsessed with my boyfriend. She goes out of her way to be paired with him in group activities (for example, if the professor picks groups by numbering us 1, 2, 3, she will move herself to be in the same number as him) and she recently stepped down from a main role in a play we're doing so she could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. I know this is the case, because I've heard her say to her friends that she thinks he's hot and what not.\n\nI've never said anything to her about it, because she seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how she thinks she's ugly) and I don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. However, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. I rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up to my boyfriend. She was a little bit drunk, and when she went up to him I was there too.\n\nVictoria started saying that she knows he must have felt a spark, he's a really good kisser, etc. I snapped, and sort of shouted at her that 'you sound incredibly desperate, going after somebody else's boyfriend. You're pathetic if you think a stage kiss means you should be together.'\n\nShe looked super embarrassed and walked away, and I later heard she'd gone home crying. I feel like a dick because she's obviously insecure and whatnot, and her friends haven't stopped calling me a bitch since. She 100% knows that I am his girlfriend, I have heard her talking about me being his girlfriend before.",

We had been planning to get married in November 2020 but I found out at the start of this month that she cheated on me. She begged me to give her another chance but I broke it off. \n\n\nThe problem was that being cheated on is, in my mind, completely emasculating and humiliating. So I never told anyone that was the reason we broke up. For obvious reasons, Sarah also didn\u2019t tell people we broke up because she cheated. So people have \u201cblamed\u201d me for the breakup, including my mom. They just see that I dumped her out of the blue. \n\n\nI\u2019ve gone very strict no contact with Sarah after I discovered she was cheating on me. Sarah has been talking with my mom and has convinced her that if we could talk one more time, we would be able to reconcile. My mom has been applying hard core pressure on me to talk with Sarah but I\u2019ve explained that there\u2019s no chance we will ever get back together. \n\n\nSo tonight I go over to my mom\u2019s place because she\u2019s hosting family for Christmas Eve. I\u2019m there for a bit talking with my aunts and uncles and cousins when the doorbell rings and I can see it\u2019s Sarah. I ask wtf is going on and my mom says she invited Sarah so we can work this out in the spirit of the holidays. \n\n\nI\u2019m pissed now because the only way to explain my side of the story is to tell everyone I was cheated on. Complete humiliation in front of my whole family. So as my mom goes to the front door, I go into the bathroom. My mom starts knocking on the door saying that I need to come out and talk to my ex like an adult. I say fuck it, kick out the window screen and get in my car and go home. \n\n\nMy mom called a short while ago saying she\u2019s cutting ties with me over my behavior (she\u2019s really fixated on me jumping out of a window) and that Sarah will always be like a child to her. My sister called me after to ream me out for ruining Christmas. I broke down and told her that Sarah cheated on me which is why I dumped her and didn\u2019t want to see her under any circumstances. She called me a big asshole who was lying to cover for myself.  Am I really in the wrong?",

I don't know a lot about kids and I've never babysat for long, and I had a feeling it would be stressful and difficult.\n\nSo I said $35, which is below what I make hourly at work, and what is the bare minimum I'd value my time for, if that time is spent doing difficult work. \n\nAnd she went crazy at me, saying that's a ridiculous rate for babysitting, that I was entitled and being selfish, that I'm trying to take advantage of how she didn't have other options, etc.\n\nI said that's way below what I'd be making if I had the time to do my own work, and I'd be putting off my own work to babysit. \n\nHer husband then got mad at me saying that I was a 24 year old girl, that I'm damn near a child myself, that my time is not worth that much and it's childish to say that it was. And that I was a stupid girl for not knowing that babysitting costs like 15 an hour, when I grew up and have kids of my own I will see how stupid I was being.\n\nI was kind of done with being called stupid so I just told them I hoped they could find someone else.\n\nMy mom thinks that I asked for something offensive, and my cousin and her husband obviously did too.",

I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she\u2019s non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. She also doesn\u2019t understand stuff. That\u2019s probably the easiest way to put it. She\u2019s just a human body with nothing inside. \n\nShe\u2019s my stepmoms daughter. My stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. I don\u2019t know my stepmom very well and I don\u2019t really get on with her. We are respectful to each other but I\u2019m basically living with strangers because she\u2019s so busy with her daughter and my dad. I am always on my own and I used to hate it but I\u2019m used to it now.\n\nEver since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. That\u2019s fine, I get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that I don\u2019t want to do and I resent doing. Stuff like staying home when I want to go to the mall with my friends, they\u2019re disappointed that I don\u2019t get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc. \n\nMy own mom passed away when I was small so I can\u2019t go and stay anywhere else and all in all I\u2019m just a lot more angry than I used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever I say I don\u2019t want to do anything for her. Even stuff like feeding her- like- I don\u2019t want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. I didn\u2019t ask for this. \n\nAnyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. She was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. I don\u2019t want to go and visit her. I remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and I just hate hospitals and I sort of hate my stepsister and I just don\u2019t want to go and visit someone who doesn\u2019t even know I\u2019m there. \n\nMy stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. They haven\u2019t yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because I don\u2019t want to visit. My grandma who lives in Canada called me up out the blue and told me it was okay and I don\u2019t need to force myself to go to the hospital so I\u2019m assuming my dad has told her I\u2019m refusing to go. He keeps pleading with me but I keep telling him I\u2019m not doing it. I told him hospitals remind me of mom and he got even more upset and said my stepsister might die and I need to stop being so selfish towards my stepmom.",

Our friends and family are mostly local and should all be able to travel to the beach in under an hour, except for some extended family flying in from Canada, but that's unavoidable.\n\nBased on our geographic location and the date of the wedding next summer, we've scheduled the ceremony start time for 5:30 a.m., when there should be plenty of light but the sun itself won't be quite visible yet.\n\nWe've been getting a LOT of backlash from our families about this, who say this is way too early and we need to move the ceremony to a more \"normal\" time of day. But my fiance and I don't feel like we're asking for anything that unreasonable.",

They knew the ceremony time, and my husband and I made it very clear to everyone, both in the invites and in person, that we were going to start exactly at that time. The venue cost us a lot of money (we paid for the entire wedding ourselves) and we were only able to use it for a limited amount of time, so we wanted to make every minute count. \n\nSo the wedding day came, and half an hour before we were scheduled to start, my parents still hadn't showed up. My husband and I both called them multiple times but nobody answered. We waited and waited, and still heard nothing. Finally, the start time arrived and my parents still weren't there. I was really pissed off at this point. The wedding coordinator asked if I wanted to go ahead and start the wedding, and I said yes. All of our other guests were already there, and we wanted to be considerate of their time. \n\nMy parents showed up 15 minutes later and missed the entire ceremony. It turns out they did leave early but got rear-ended at a traffic light and had to deal with insurance, police, etc. They only have a landline, no cellphones, so they couldn't get in touch with me.

        "body": "This has been an ongoing argument between my wife and I, but it resulted in a huge argument today and I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m in the wrong. I think it\u2019s impossible for someone in my position to see my wife\u2019s point of view fairly so tell me who\u2019s the asshole here. I\u2019m also not interested in any relationship advice, our marriage is fine, it\u2019s solely this topic/argument that I\u2019m interested in hearing your judgement on.\n\nSo my wife and I have two kids together. But before I met my wife I had a daughter with my now ex-wife. My daughter passed away when she was 7, and the emotional toll of this destroyed my marriage with my ex-wife. We haven\u2019t said a word to each other in almost a decade and I have no desire to speak with her anyway.\n\nI still own the same house as then and I\u2019ve pretty much left my daughters room as it was. At first it was just because there was no reason to, but now it\u2019s kind of like a memorial in some weird sense? I can\u2019t really explain the logic behind it because I don\u2019t think there is any. It just doesn\u2019t feel right to change her room.\n\nThis has been the cause of the only arguments my wife and I have really had. The house has four bedrooms, so each of our kids have a room, we have a shared room, and then there\u2019s my daughters old room. My kids know not to go in there and it\u2019s just left there. Occasionally I will go in there and read a book, or just lie down on her bed. It\u2019s therapeutic in some weird way.\n\nMy wife has always wanted to change the room. At first it was because she wanted a study, but I refused and eventually she gave up. \n\nWe\u2019re now talking about having a third child and naturally she wants our new kid to have my daughters old room. Again I put my foot down and said that wasn\u2019t an option, and that our two older kids can share a room instead.\n\n She really blew up at me and told me she was sick of me holding on to the past. She was sick of me being unable to compromise on this. She was sick of feeling like my deceased daughter came first. She said a lot of things but I think that basically sums it up.\n\nWhen she said these things I was really hurt. But I\u2019ve had a few hours to think it over, and I think I might be the unreasonable asshole here. It\u2019s not fair to make my kids share a room because I won\u2019t let go of the past. It\u2019s not fair to have a memorial reminds my wife that she wasn\u2019t my first love.",

        "body": "A bit of backstory. I met my wife in the summer of 2008. She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.",

Yesterday I got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (Barb) house. \n\nI immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since Christmas so I overlooked it and said we (my wife and I ) were in. \n\nWe were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. We all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (Tim) informed the family that his wife (Ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. The affair was with a long time close family friend (Chris) who lived a block away.\n\n\nChris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law Tim. \n\nBoth families have been friends for years. They live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. Honestly, I have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. Hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. \n\nAnyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. \n\nI broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. Saying this was the best april fools gag I've ever seen but I wasn't falling for it. I told Ashley and especially Tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. \n\nBeing the newest member of the family (my wife and I married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. I probably should not have said anything. \n\nEveryone in the room looked horrified. \n\nMy mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. She left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. \n\nTim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. Then berating me for being so insensitive. \n\n\nThe rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...\n\n\nI am still dumbfounded. In hindsight, I probably should have sat in silence... but I honestly still feel like I was calling out an april fools gag. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\n",

Wife hasn\u2019t been too happy since returning to her job from her last maternity leave and I actually just got a new job. \n\nAt my old job I was working 45-50 hours a week. At my new job my hours fluctuate a lot \u2014 it can be anywhere from 60 to 80ish hours a week at the worst. I make a lot more though so there\u2019s that. The pay raise makes it so my family can do really well on just one paycheck. My wife is ecstatic because this means she can be a SAHM which is what she\u2019s wanted. \n\nThe issue is that my wife and I aren\u2019t on the same page about what this change would mean. Before, when our work hours were almost equal, we divided housework pretty much equally. We also paid a housekeeping staff to come every other week to help us out. (Plus we have a nanny to care for our kids while we work). \n\nI told my wife that her staying home would mean no more housekeeping staff or nanny. These cuts will help us afford to have just the one income and I also think it\u2019s practical.  She was mostly agreeable to that. But then she said that we should divide the chores 50-50 still. \n\nI told her there was no way I was going to be taking on as many work hours as I am and then come home to cook or clean too. That would defeat the entire purpose of her quitting her job. \n\nShe looked at me like I was some sort of Neanderthal but I think what I\u2019m saying is completely fair. I\u2019m not expecting her to do any heavy lifting. Just tending to the kids, cooking, and doing a reasonable job keeping up the house. I recognize that this would be an old fashioned way of living and if she ever wanted to return to the workforce I would support her 100%. But I think it\u2019s fair that if I\u2019m the sole paycheck and working crazy hours I don\u2019t come home to more stress and chaos. \n\nObviously my wife and I will have to work this out between ourselves. I\u2019m mainly posting here as a sanity check to see if my thoughts on this issue are completely off base. \n\n**",
